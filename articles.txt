{"directed viral star lie greif michael review ben tragedy platt breakout evan teenager starring gorgeous dear heartbreaker core hansen musical downer": "\nAs the title character in \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d a lonely teenager who inadvertently becomes a social media sensation and a symbol of the kindness that is often cruelly absent in high school hallways, the marvelous young actor Ben Platt is giving a performance that\u2019s not likely to be bettered on Broadway this season.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this gorgeous heartbreaker of a musical, which opened at the Music Box Theater on Sunday, has grown in emotional potency during its journey to the big leagues, after first being produced in Washington and Off Broadway. Rarely \u2013 scratch that \u2014 never have I heard so many stifled sobs and sniffles in the theater.\n\nFor those allergic to synthetic sentiment, rest assured that the show, with a haunting score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (the coming movie musical \u201cLa La Land,\u201d for which they wrote the lyrics, is already generating Oscar buzz), matched by a book of equal sensitivity by Steven Levenson, doesn\u2019t sledgehammer home its affecting story. On the contrary, the musical finds endless nuances in the relationships among its characters, and makes room for some leavening humor, too. It is also the rare Broadway musical not derived from or inspired by some other source, which is refreshing in itself.\n\nEvan Hansen, at first glance, may appear to be a stock figure: the misfit kid who\u2019s too shy make friends and eats lunch in the cafeteria alone. But Mr. Platt\u2019s remarkable performance instantly scrubs free any trace of the generic.\n\nHis Evan is a startling jumble of exposed nerve endings. His eyes blink in continual embarrassment at the twisted pretzels of words that tumble from his mouth whenever he has to interact socially, which isn\u2019t often. He quails at the thought of having to make small talk with a pizza delivery guy. Underneath the thick layers of insecurity, however, Mr. Platt transmits the yearning heart and the desperation for affection \u2014 or even just attention \u2014 that ultimately gets Evan into deep trouble.\n\nThe fateful encounter that sets the plot in motion takes place when Evan is in the computer room at school, printing out one of the daily pep-talk letters to himself that his therapist has advised him to write. It\u2019s snatched up by another loner, Connor Murphy (Mike Faist), but one with a mean streak. He snickers, stuffs it in his pocket and then, noticing that no one has signed the cast on Evan\u2019s broken arm, mockingly scrawls his name across it in giant letters.\n\nBut we soon learn that Connor\u2019s psychological travails run deeper than Evan\u2019s. Not long after this unpleasant incident, Connor kills himself. And when his family finds Evan\u2019s letter, they naturally assume it was written by Connor to his friend. In their bewilderment and sadness they reach out to him, hoping he can shed some light on why their son had become so remote and unhappy.\n\nAlthough Evan tries to stutter out the truth, ultimately he cannot bear to tell them the real provenance of the letter, for reasons both compassionate \u2014 he can sense how dearly they want to believe Connor was not just the alienated kid he seemed to be \u2014 and self-serving. Evan has long had a crush on Connor\u2019s sister, Zoe (Laura Dreyfuss). His growing closeness to Connor\u2019s parents \u2014 Larry (Michael Park) and Cynthia (Jennifer Laura Thompson) \u2014 naturally draws Zoe nearer to him.\n\nEvan\u2019s troubles are compounded when news of the (fake) friendship spreads at school. An ambitious fellow student, Alana, played with the bossy eagerness of a classic overachiever by Kristolyn Lloyd, decides to start a fund in Connor\u2019s name. When Evan is talked into giving a speech at an assembly, as the co-president of what Alana has called the Connor Project, his talk becomes a social media sensation. \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d reflects how such platforms have become both a way of advocating for good and inspiring collective engagement, but it also suggests that viral movements may be mere mirages, and can spiral out of control, potentially doing more damage than good. (The set, by David Korins, is dominated by a series of screens that flash spasmodically with images of posts and tweets when the Connor Project spreads like a wildfire.)\n\nAs Evan becomes more entangled in his deceptions, Mr. Platt\u2019s performance grows richer and more wrenching. We see how seductive Evan finds this newfound attention, but also how the knowledge of his duplicity is eating away at him. Even as he basks in a new confidence, he senses \u2014 as we do \u2014 part of his soul slipping away.\n\nUnder the superb direction of the veteran Michael Greif, the show has been subtly refined, its brasher comedy softened, and the performances have grown in delicacy. Rachel Bay Jones is immensely touching as Evan\u2019s mother, who has raised him by herself and grows mournful as she sees her son entering the orbit of another family.\n\nMr. Park and Ms. Thompson are likewise excellent, indicating how bringing Evan into their lives helps heal their wounds, which, of course, only compounds his guilt. As Zoe, who at first resents the picture of her brother as a lonely martyr \u2014 he was nothing but nasty to her \u2014 Ms. Dreyfuss gives a sensitive, altogether lovely performance. And as Jared, Evan\u2019s only friend, Will Roland provides nice injections of snarky humor, as he is corralled into helping Evan hide the truth by fabricating a series of emails.\n\nMr. Paul and Mr. Pasek\u2019s score is woven with unusual seamlessness into Mr. Levenson\u2019s book. And while the majority of the songs are soft-spoken, reflective ballads, with guitar and strings leading the way (there\u2019s no brass in the small orchestra), they are varied and gently melodic, each opening up a window that gives a new perspective on the characters and their predicaments. Particularly memorable is the soaring anthem that closes the first act, and is reprised in the second, \u201cYou Will Be Found,\u201d which becomes one of the rallying cries for the social media movement that the death of Connor \u2014 and Evan\u2019s speech about him \u2014 incites.\n\nNaturally, the story of a teenage suicide and a lonely young man caught up in a web of self-devised deception has its sad aspects. But \u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d is anything but a downer; the feelings it stirs are cathartic expressions of a healthy compassion for Evan\u2019s efforts to do good, and his anguish that he may be causing more trouble than he can cure.\n\nThe musical is ideal for families looking for something yeastier and more complex than the usual sugary diversions. But then it should also appeal to just about anyone who has ever felt, at some point in life, that he or she was trapped \u201con the outside looking in,\u201d as one lyric has it. Which is just about everybody with a beating heart.\n", "stilluntold whistleblowing yaojie doctor blood discussed sales epidemic gao china reflects truth tied aids unsanitary dr considers roots network": "\nIn October, the pioneering Chinese AIDS fighter Gao Yaojie disclosed her wish to be cremated after death: \u201cPlease scatter my ashes in the Yellow River.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Gao, 88, a retired gynecologist who uncovered a major H.I.V. outbreak in central China in the late 1990s, also had a more pointed message: \u201cI do not want what I have achieved in this life to become a tool for others to gain fame and profit.\u201d\n\nWhat she has achieved is considerable. In 1996, she was called in to examine a female patient with mysterious symptoms at a hospital in Zhengzhou, Henan Province. The woman had become infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion obtained from a blood bank.\n\nDr. Gao started her investigations and discovered an unsanitary blood collection and sales network, abetted by local officials, that had spread tainted blood throughout the region. Many residents were selling their blood, which was pooled with blood from other donors. After plasma was extracted, the rest of the pooled blood, now often carrying H.I.V. or other infections, was reinjected into donors, so they could give more frequently. Dr. Gao\u2019s work to expose the epidemic and help its victims won her international acclaim but harassment at home. Her movements were increasingly restricted, her phone was tapped, and she was stalked when she ventured outdoors.\n\nIn 2009, she decided to leave China. \u201cIt was because I want to tell the truth to the world,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. In 2010, she was appointed a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York, and she continues to live nearby. (Her husband, also a physician, died in 2006.) She has written several books on AIDS as well as a collection of poetry. In an interview before World AIDS Day on Thursday, Dr. Gao talked about her life in the United States and what she considers the still-untold truth about the AIDS epidemic in China.\n\nWhy did you release the statement about your wishes after death?\n\nIn 2005, as my husband was struggling with throat cancer, we thought about water burial. Being buried in the ground was out of the question, because in Henan, the lease on a grave is only good for 20 years. Afterward, you have to pay more to keep it.\n\nI would like my son to carry out the water burial for me. When he was 11, he was jailed for three years for being connected to me. [During the Cultural Revolution, Dr. Gao was denounced as being from a \u201clandlord\u201d family.] After he was rehabilitated, he went on to university and became a professor. Now that I\u2019ve gone abroad, he\u2019s become worried that the Gao clan might charge him with filial impiety if he \u201cthrew his mother into the water.\u201d So I wrote this statement. After I die, my son will take my ashes and scatter them in the Yellow River.\n\nActually, that isn\u2019t the chief problem. It\u2019s the fact that some people have used my name for their own advantage. Some have used my name to raise money without my knowledge.\n\nIn 2009, you came to the United States and said you would tell the world the truth behind the AIDS epidemic in China. What is that truth?\n\nThe root of AIDS in China was the plasma market, which was introduced not only in Henan but in other provinces as well. Henan was severely affected, however. From the late 1980s to early 1990s, the plasma market took off in several parts of Henan. Then Liu Quanxi became director of the Henan Health Department and strongly pushed the policy, which encouraged farmers to sell their blood. From 1992 to 1998, as a result of the administration of [the provincial party secretary] Li Changchun, blood-selling became an established \u201cindustry.\u201d In a few years, blood stations had spread everywhere in Henan. Only about 230 of them were licensed. There were countless illegal ones. The places with the most blood stations then are the places with the most severe AIDS problem now. From 1998 to 2004, under [now Premier] Li Keqiang, who succeeded Li Changchun in Henan, the AIDS incubation period, which is five to eight years, passed, and a great number of people infected with H.I.V. began showing AIDS symptoms and died. AIDS not only killed individuals but destroyed countless families.\n\nThis was a man-made catastrophe. Yet the people responsible for it have never been brought to account, nor have they uttered a single word of apology.\n\nI am very angry now. Why? In 2004, the government, which had begun to acknowledge the existence of the AIDS epidemic, sent medical teams to 38 \u201cAIDS villages\u201d in Henan. Yet there were so many other people in Henan who did not get the needed treatment, not to mention those in other provinces. In 2004, the Chinese government began to register AIDS patients and put out this policy: Those with symptoms would get 200 renminbi each month. Those who didn\u2019t yet show symptoms would get 150 renminbi. This came with a condition, however, which was that one must write \u201csexual transmission\u201d under \u201ccause of infection,\u201d because the authorities had ordered that \u201cblood transmission\u201d not appear in the questionnaire.\n\nThey hid the truth from the public. They wouldn\u2019t let the victims say it was blood transmission, only homosexual activity or drug use or prostitution. Since the officials suppressed information about the epidemic while cracking down on anyone who tried to report the facts or go to Beijing to file petitions, the epidemic wasn\u2019t contained in time but kept getting worse.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2003, Vice Premier Wu Yi met with me and we spent three hours discussing the problem. She said, \u201cSomeone told me that the main routes of AIDS infection in China are drug use and sex.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s a lie. If you don\u2019t believe me I can call a rickshaw and pull you there myself so you can see what\u2019s happening.\u201d She finally believed me, but soon the toadies were around her again and telling her homosexuality and sex were the main causes.\n\nHave official attitudes changed under President Xi Jinping?\n\nIt must be said that the government indirectly admits the existence of the plasma disaster. I have two pieces of evidence: One is Xi Jinping\u2019s wife, Peng Liyuan. In September 2015, in her speech at the United Nations, Peng mentioned a 5-year-old orphan named Gao Jun. He is now 15 and is from Anhui Province. His parents were infected with H.I.V. from selling blood. He was the first person affected by the epidemic Peng had come into contact with after she became the [Health Ministry\u2019s] ambassador for H.I.V./AIDS prevention [in 2006].\n\nThe other evidence is from December 2015, when the AIDS orphans project of Du Cong\u2019s Chi Heng Foundation was awarded the China Charity Award by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Du Cong, who had came to China\u2019s rural areas in 2002 for a work project, started to help orphans after seeing the situation in the AIDS villages. So far, the foundation has raised about 200 million renminbi [$29 million] and helped more than 20,000 people, including more than 600 orphans.\n\nOn the other hand, the Central Committee\u2019s Leading Group for Inspection Work sent a team to Henan in 2014 for a two-month investigation. The first day that they stayed at the Yellow River Hotel in Zhengzhou, more than 300 plasma market victims gathered in front of the hotel to submit their complaints. But they were warded off by officials and the police.\n\nIs the blood disaster under control now?\n\nIn 1995, Henan Province began closing some blood-collecting stations. However, illegal blood stations are still active. Last year, I read four news reports about illegal blood stations, three in Beijing, one in Nanjing. Of course, there must be some illegal blood stations that have not been detected. And I think the spread of H.I.V. is not totally under control. Last year, I read a report about a woman who was infected with H.I.V. through a blood transfusion during surgery in Tongxu County, in Henan, which indicates there are still problems with blood donors. Unfortunately, the victims are farmers, and most of them are illiterate. They don\u2019t know what happened to them. They don\u2019t know how to speak up for themselves. They think this happened because of an unavoidable fate. In recent years, they have begun petitioning for their rights, but their situation is still very bad.\n\nHow is your life in America?\n\nBecause I can\u2019t speak English, I don\u2019t go out that often. Every month I pay $2,000 for my apartment. The money comes from funds Professor Andrew Nathan [of Columbia University] raised for me. Since I didn\u2019t work in the United States in my younger days or pay taxes, I feel rather uncomfortable asking the government for assistance. But in fact I am being taken care of by the United States. Every month I get $87 worth of food stamps. All my renumerations and award money goes to buying copies of my books and donating them.\n\nFor some time, I\u2019ve had high blood pressure and blood clots in my left leg. In the past three years, I\u2019ve hardly been able to walk. A caretaker is with me 24 hours a day. My life in the United States is busy. I receive at least six letters a day. And I have many visitors.\n", "indianas trump power suggests rules programs verma states strict donald spread medicaid trumps pick nomination remodel seema": "\nIn most of the United States, anyone poor enough to qualify for Medicaid simply receives whatever care doctors recommend at minimal cost. But many Medicaid enrollees in Indiana can\u2019t get full benefits unless they pay monthly premiums, and some who fail to pay can be shut out of coverage entirely for six months. If they go to the emergency room too often, they have to pay a fee.\n\nThese provisions were unprecedented departures for the program last year, and they were negotiated with federal health officials by Seema Verma, a consultant, on behalf of Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president-elect. This week Donald J. Trump chose Ms. Verma to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the influential agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees Medicare, Medicaid and the Obamacare insurance markets.\n\nIt is not clear what Ms. Verma may have planned for Medicare, a fully federal program that covers millions of older Americans and that usually makes up most of the administrator\u2019s job. Administrators of the agency typically come with some Medicare experience, and Ms. Verma appears to have little.\n\nHer policy priorities for Medicaid are much clearer. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and to create new systems for providing health insurance to low and middle-income Americans. But even without legislation, the executive branch can do a lot to reshape existing programs by giving states more power. Ms. Verma\u2019s nomination suggests that the administration will become much more enthusiastic about approving novel Medicaid policies like those adopted in Indiana.\n\nThe Healthy Indiana Plan, as it\u2019s known, \u201chas been successful in meeting its policy objectives, but it also continues to demonstrate the potential for consumer-driven health care as an alternative to the traditional Medicaid model,\u201d Ms. Verma wrote in an article in the journal Health Affairs this summer, arguing that other states should adopt its provisions. (An employee of her consulting firm said Ms. Verma was not doing interviews or answering questions.)\n\nThe Medicaid statute allows states to throw out many, but not all, program rules to test whether they can deliver better care to Medicaid patients at a similar cost. The bright lines about which rules can be waived are often decided in court.\n\nThe Obama administration has been open to new ideas in Medicaid, in part because it has wanted to encourage Republican-led states to expand coverage to more of their residents. It has allowed major policy experiments in Arkansas and Iowa, but the Indiana plan pushed the furthest in requiring beneficiaries to spend their own money and follow complex rules to continue receiving full benefits.\n\nOther changes to Medicaid long favored by Republican state officials, like requirements that applicants work to obtain benefits, could also be approved. The Obama administration has argued that such requirements violate the Medicaid statute.\n\nRepublican state officials argue that such rules help beneficiaries take a greater stake in their own health and help them learn the value of their benefits.\n\n\u201cWhen things aren\u2019t completely free, people begin to make more careful decisions about how and how much to consume,\u201d said Mitch Daniels, the former Indiana governor, who worked with Ms. Verma on an early version of the plan. Mr. Daniels, now the president of Purdue University, praised her as an \u201cindispensible technician\u201d for her efforts in devising the proposal.\n\nAnalysts have criticized the Indiana program, saying that there hasn\u2019t been good evidence that beneficiaries understood the incentive structure or changed their behavior because of it. They have also raised concerns that the program is complex and hard to manage \u2014 that the cost of collecting small premiums exceeds the revenue the state receives. Judith Solomon, the vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the state had not cooperated with efforts to independently evaluate the program.\n\nAt the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Ms. Verma could also encourage large changes in middle-class coverage. A provision in the Affordable Care Act allows states to replace traditional Medicaid and the Obamacare insurance marketplaces with a different system if it can be demonstrated that the plan would cover a similar number of people at a similar cost. The provision was envisioned as a way to allow liberal states to pursue single-payer systems. But health policy experts believe it could also be used to reshape many of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance market rules.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act really federalized the health insurance market, so now we can decentralize that again, bring that authority back to the states in determining what benefits are,\u201d said Dennis Smith, a former federal director of Medicaid in the Bush administration, who has also run the Wisconsin Medicaid program. He is now working for the Medicaid agency in Arkansas.\n\nOther Medicaid experts worry about new barriers to health care, if the Trump administration approves plans that Obama administration officials have blocked.\n\n\u201cWe can expect to see far-reaching changes contemplated for Medicaid that will erect many more barriers to coverage \u2014 and very punitive barriers,\u201d said Joan Alker, the executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, in an email. \u201cFor example, forcing people to remain uninsured for up to year if they miss a paperwork deadline or a premium payment, even though we know that conditions like mental illness or homelessness \u2014 or something more simple like a notice getting lost in the mail \u2014 may explain the missed deadline.\u201d\n\nBut experts across the political spectrum agree: Ms. Verma\u2019s appointment will probably usher in a new era of state flexibility in health care.\n", "work talked takes hard fantasy brooklyn book experts ultimate bookstore open nerds": "\nFor more than 20 years, small bookstores have been vanishing, their business models under pressure from large competitors and internet retailers.\n\nIn the last several years, though, there are signs that independent bookstores are making a comeback in New York and other cities, in part through innovative financing that gives neighborhoods a stake in the businesses.\n\nA case in point: Jessica Stockton Bagnulo and Rebecca Fitting, the owners of Greenlight Bookstore in Fort Greene, have just opened a new location in a second Brooklyn neighborhood, Prospect Lefferts Garden.\n\nI\u2019m surely not the only bookworm who has fantasized about working in a bookstore: The quiet, convivial atmosphere; the rows of spines with titles you have always meant to read; the enthusiastic conversations about books.\n\nBut as I learned, it\u2019s not quite as relaxing as it looks.\n\nIn interviews, the Greenlight owners and other bookstore entrepreneurs in New York walked me through some of the decisions that need to be taken into account in such a venture.\n\nWhen Ms. Fitting and Ms. Bagnulo opened their first store, they found that banks were unwilling to lend to them.\n\nSo they asked friends, families and neighbors for loans of $1,000 or more, and pledged to pay those loans back (with interest) over the course of five years. The store did not even have an opening date, Ms. Bagnulo said, so the backers were taking \u201ca leap of faith.\u201d\n\nThey raised about $75,000 for the Fort Greene location that way, which helped to persuade conventional lenders to come on board.\n\nFor the new store, they wanted to cleave to that model.\n\nWith the help of 95 people, they raised $242,600 for the location, some of it from friends and family but the majority from people in the neighborhood.\n\nThe lessons from Greenlight are being put to use in other places. Brad Johnson, the store manager of a location of a California bookstore chain, Diesel, is using a community lender program that draws direct inspiration from the Brooklyn store.\n\nJanet Geddis, the founder and owner of Avid Bookshop in Athens, Ga., also used a version of the community lending idea to open her first location, also using several other lines of support, including a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.\n\nEmily Russo, the co-owner of a bookstore named Print in Portland, Me., used an even smaller community to raise money for opening the store, putting together about half the necessary capital with the help of her parents and her husband.\n\nAnd a Bronx-born entrepreneur, No\u00eblle Santos, is relying partly on Indiegogo and on her own savings to open The Lit Bar in the borough.\n\nGeo Ong, who has worked at Diesel and will manage the new Greenlight location, said that the phenomenon of independents opening with these sorts of models across the country gave the lie to a recent narrative that \u201cbookstores don\u2019t succeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of a bookstore\u2019s success is case-by-case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that some bookstores are thriving and a lot of bookstores are opening means that there\u2019s something inherently successful in the model.\u201d\n\nMs. Bagnulo said there were two major questions to consider when deciding where to open a bookstore: Which city neighborhoods are in need of one, and which can support one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of joking, but the rule of thumb is, if the neighborhood can support a farmers market, the neighborhood can support a bookstore,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Santos, 29, is evaluating a location in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the borough.\n\nShe said she was confident that the area could support a bookstore, saying The Lit Bar, as her store will be called, will be the only independent bookstore in the Bronx.\n\nThough she grew up as a self-described \u201cBarnes & Noble kid,\u201d she has embraced the need for neighborhoods to have their own independent bookstores.\n\n\u201cWhen you come into a neighborhood like the South Bronx, where most of our population is Hispanic and African-American, you need your stores, your community centers and your organizations to reflect the people that actually live there,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the new Greenlight store, Ms. Fitting and Ms. Bagnulo commissioned the work of the architect Frederick Tang, who also designed the Fort Green store.\n\n\u201cWe want to make the store beautiful and thoughtful and designed but we don\u2019t want it to be inaccessible and snobby,\u201d she said. They worried about everything from the lighting to the color of the wood shelves (they settled on a honey tone).\n\nA narrow storefront and low-hanging pipes constrained some of the space, but Mr. Tang figured out a way to make the ceiling higher in places where the pipes were less plentiful.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be somewhere you can come hang out and have a conversation,\u201d Ms. Bagnulo said, \u201cor where you can have a loud party, or where you can have speakers who are going to curse, where kids and families and babies can come hang out during story time.\u201d\n\nMs. Fitting, a former sales representative at Random House, where she helped sell books to independents, handles much of the book purchasing.\n\n\u201cFor this store, I handpicked every freaking title,\u201d she said, all 7,248 of them.\n\nMs. Fitting said that she tried to put her personal inflection on the inventory, for example, buying \u201cThe Gift\u201d by Lewis Hyde, during the holiday season, which she said was \u201cone of the best gifts that you could give to any creative person, or to yourself.\u201d\n\nBut she said she never avoided buying a book because she didn\u2019t personally like it, and tried hard not to make assumptions about what might sell well. That said, it\u2019s true that conservative political books are not big local sellers.\n\n\u201cA new Bill O\u2019Reilly book comes out, and we buy one because someone in our marketplace might want one, or might want to give it someone else,\u201d she added.\n\nShe said that big books like David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d and Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina,\u201d tended to sell well in the winter, a combination of New Year\u2019s resolutions to finally conquer certain tomes and the simple fact that people stay in more in the winters.\n\nIn the summer, Greenlight does brisk business of newer books with seasonally fitting covers, like Jess Walter\u2019s \u201cBeautiful Ruins\u201d and Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cSag Harbor.\u201d\n\nThe new store seemed to be off to a good start this weekend, having sold about 500 books.\n\nThe best-seller on the first day was Mr. Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d The top book for the entire weekend, in a bookstore owned by two working mothers, was \u201cRad Women Worldwide,\u201d by Kate Schatz.\n", "weakening nations trump destroying radical price choice donald safety health picked tom intent net man care secretary": "\nIn picking  Representative Tom Price, President-elect Donald Trump has chosen as his secretary of health and human services a man intent on systematically weakening, if not demolishing, the nation\u2019s health care safety net.\n\nMr. Price, a Republican from Georgia, is a fierce opponent of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health reform law, and beyond that, supports plans to slash Medicare and Medicaid, which cover tens of millions of elderly, disabled and low-income Americans. He is against a woman\u2019s right to choose and has backed legislation to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding.\n\nMr. Trump and many Republicans have talked vaguely about plans to repeal the health reform law but suggest they might keep some popular parts of the law. Mr. Price makes no such noises. The detailed legislation he introduced most recently in 2015 would destroy the reform law and is a good indication of his philosophy in managing the nation\u2019s largest health programs: cut benefits and leave millions with no health care at all.\n\nHis bill would, among other things, roll back the federally financed expansion of Medicaid in 31 states and the District of Columbia, taking coverage away from 14 million poor people. It would severely cut federal subsidies that help individuals and families buy policies on government-run health exchanges. The reduced subsidies would make it hard, if not impossible, for millions to afford the coverage they have gotten since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. And the bill would no longer require insurers to cover addiction treatment, birth control, maternity care, prescription drugs and other essential medical services.\n\nAs for coverage of pre-existing medical conditions \u2014 a key element of the current law, requiring insurers to sell plans to those with health problems \u2014 Mr. Price\u2019s bill has that protection only for those who maintained continuous health coverage with any insurer for the previous 18 months. This means that insurers would not be required to sell an affordable plan to anyone who did not have coverage for, say, a month while he or she was between jobs.\n\nBeyond his commitment to tearing apart the health care law, Mr. Price, who leads the House Budget Committee, published a budget proposal last year that would convert Medicaid into a block grant to state governments. This would reduce federal spending on the program by 34 percent by 2025, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Such a cut would inevitably cause states to offer fewer benefits and reduce the number of people covered, far beyond the 14 million who would lose their coverage if Medicaid expansion is rolled back.\n\nMr. Price also supports big changes to Medicare that could hurt older Americans by increasing their health care costs. A plan backed by Mr. Price and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, would turn Medicare, which covers the cost of medical care for people over 65, into a program in which people would buy private insurance through what is known as premium support. The idea is to turn Medicare into a voucher program, designed to limit federal spending while forcing seniors to bear more of the cost. Given that most American families have little or no retirement savings, this would be disastrous. It also stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise not to \u201ccut\u201d Medicare and Social Security.\n\nIt is impossible to know which parts of Mr. Price\u2019s agenda will become priorities for the new administration.

He was 90.\n\nNBC confirmed the death on Wednesday.\n\nTo a generation whose tastes were shaped by the tube, Mr. Tinker was the unseen hand behind many of the most stylish, critically acclaimed sitcoms and dramas on television. He did it by giving his writers space to thrive, shielding them from those foolish studio and network executives who said they liked the story, all right, but wanted to change the boy to a dog \u2014 and usually got their way.\n\nAs president of MTM Enterprises, a company he founded with his second wife, Mary Tyler Moore, in 1970, Mr. Tinker produced the show named for her, one of the first series to feature an independent career woman as the central character, as well as spinoffs like \u201cRhoda\u201d and the one-hour newsroom drama \u201cLou Grant,\u201d which examined societal issues.\n\nAnd as chairman and chief executive of NBC from 1981 to 1986, Mr. Tinker crammed prime time with many of television\u2019s most imaginative, successful and long-running series, including \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cHill Street Blues,\u201d \u201cFamily Ties,\u201d \u201cSt. Elsewhere\u201d and \u201cMiami Vice.\u201d\n\nBesides runaway ratings and an avalanche of awards, NBC secured annual profits that soared to $500 million, from $48 million, during Mr. Tinker\u2019s tenure.\n\nAfter decades of formula network programming that, with notable exceptions, had made a wasteland of television, Mr. Tinker changed the landscape, using ensemble casts and intertwined story lines, casting blacks and women in leading roles and examining serious topical issues: life and death in a hospital for the poor; conflicts in a family or an impoverished police precinct; a reporter\u2019s look at civil rights, insanity or checkbook journalism.\n\nNurturing many writers and producers whose work dominated network television for years to come, Mr. Tinker resigned from NBC after General Electric took over its parent company, RCA, in 1986. With Gannett, the media conglomerate, he later formed GTG Entertainment and produced a newsmagazine for television and other shows. But GTG failed to repeat his earlier successes, and the company was dissolved in 1990.\n\nThough relatively unknown to audiences, Mr. Tinker was a legend in television, especially to his writers. \u201cGrant Tinker\u2019s real unique gift is in creating an environment where people feel safe, nurtured, protected to do what they do best,\u201d Steven Bochco, a creator of \u201cHill Street Blues,\u201d told The New York Times in 1986.\n\nGary Goldberg, who created \u201cFamily Ties,\u201d a sitcom about hippie parents from the \u201960s and their children in the \u201980s, including a conservative son, had no TV experience when he arrived at MTM.\n\n\u201cGrant let me know a writer was special,\u201d he recalled in 1987. \u201cHe said I was not there to find out what the networks wanted. He said what had to come through in my shows was my personality, my view of the world. Grant makes everyone he comes into contact with better.\u201d\n\nGrant Almerin Tinker was born on Jan. 11, 1926, in Stamford, Conn., the son of a lumber supplier. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1949 and joined NBC as an executive trainee, but left in 1954. He went into advertising and for seven years developed programs for television \u2014 as ad agencies did then \u2014 first for McCann-Erickson and later for Benton & Bowles.\n\nMr. Tinker rejoined NBC in 1961 and was put in charge of West Coast programming. In Los Angeles he developed \u201cI Spy,\u201d \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d\n\nHe returned to New York as the head of programming in 1966, but quit in 1967 to return to California, where he developed television series for Universal \u2014 including \u201cIt Takes a Thief\u201d and \u201cMarcus Welby, M.D.\u201d \u2014 and for 20th Century Fox.\n\nSetting out as an independent in 1970, Mr. Tinker and Ms. Moore formed MTM to produce \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d for CBS. Created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns, the show had phenomenal success over the next seven years, which led to a host of spinoff hits and a growing stable of writers and producers eager to work in a creative atmosphere.\n\nBy 1981, when Mr. Tinker was hired to resurrect NBC, the network was in the doldrums, with dismal ratings, sagging profits and defections by viewers, affiliates and advertisers, all of which threatened NBC\u2019s very survival.\n\nA harsh critic of network programming, including NBC\u2019s, he seemed an unlikely savior. But by 1986, NBC recaptured prime time and profits, while holding its own with the \u201cToday\u201d show, the \u201cNBC Nightly News With Tom Brokaw\u201d and Johnny Carson and David Letterman in the late-night slots.\n\nMr. Tinker and the former Ruth Byerly were married in 1950 and divorced in 1962. They had four children. Mr. Tinker and Ms. Moore, who married in 1963 and divorced in 1981, had no children.\n\nMr. Tinker\u2019s survivors include his wife, Brooke Knapp; his sons, Mark, John and Michael; his daughter, Jodie DiLella; his sister, Joan Swift; 10 grandchildren and many great-grandchildren.\n\nWith Bud Rukeyser, NBC\u2019s longtime head of corporate communications, Mr. Tinker wrote \u201cTinker in Television: From General Sarnoff to General Electric\u201d (1994), an account of his four decades in the business.\n\nMr. Tinker received a personal Peabody Award, the most prestigious in the industry. \u201cWe\u2019re honoring him not just because of the MTM and NBC years,\u201d said Horace Newcomb, the awards director, \u201cbut also because when you look at the people who are revered for their TV work, you find many of them worked under Mr. Tinker. His was a world in which TV\u2019s best was accomplished.\u201d\n", "product nestl stomach consumers taste sweet candy sugar reformulates made": "\nCall it sugar lite.\n\nNestl\u00e9, the international food behemoth, announced Wednesday that it had developed a way of restructuring sugar, allowing the company to reduce the amount of sugar in its candy products.\n\n\u201cIt is sugar, but it is assembled differently so it can disassemble easily in your mouth with less going into your gastrointestinal tract,\u201d said Dr. Stefan Catsicas, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.\n\nNestl\u00e9 declined to fully explain the process, because the company is pursuing patents for it. But Dr. Catsicas compared a normal crystal of sugar to a shoe box, where the box is made of sugar and everything inside it is also made of sugar. The new sugar, he said, will be processed to have the same sugar exterior \u2014 though it may be a globe instead of a box \u2014 to dissolve in the mouth. Because less sugar is inside, less goes to the stomach.\n\nNestl\u00e9 said the new sugar would be introduced in products starting in 2018, and that more details about it would be released next year.\n\nIf the new sugar lives up to its billing, it would represent a milestone in the food business\u2019s never-ending quest for more healthful ways to sweeten products. Nestl\u00e9 will initially use the product to reduce sugar in its confectionery lines by as much as 40 percent, Dr. Catsicas said.\n\n\u201cReducing sugar is the holy grail of food companies these days \u2014 but does it work?\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor in the department of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.\n\nProfessor Nestle, who has no connection to the company, said it was impossible to know how much promise the product has, particularly because candy \u2014 which the food business prefers to call \u201cconfections\u201d \u2014 is not the biggest source of sugar in the diet. \u201cThat\u2019s soda, and then what the Department of Agriculture calls grain-based desserts,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Catsicas said Nestl\u00e9 would have preferred to make the announcement after receiving patents and trademark protection. But he said the news was already leaking, and the company wanted to tell its own story rather than allowing someone else to do so.\n\nNestl\u00e9 might eventually sell its new sugar to other food companies for use in their products, Dr. Catsicas said. But he added that \u201cit is not something that can be mixed into your coffee.\u201d It also cannot be used to sweeten soda, the company said.\n\nNestl\u00e9, which, like many big food companies, is working to reduce the fat, salt and sugar in its products, previously developed a way to reduce fat in ice cream. Its \u201cslow-churned\u201d ice creams are processed in such a way that they require less fat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about thinking: How can I expose my sensory system to the taste I\u2019m looking for but with the minimum of that ingredient \u2014 and without replacing it with something else,\u201d Dr. Catsicas said.\n", "beijing material smog infecting genes genetic bacteria find antibioticresistant live discovering capable fear skepticism researchers": "\nBEIJING \u2014 A report that Beijing\u2019s already notorious smog contained bacteria with antibiotic-resistant genes spread through the city last week like pathogens in a pandemic disaster movie.\n\n\u201cDrug-resistant bacteria make people very afraid,\u201d The Beijing Evening News said in an article reposted by Xinhua, the state news agency, after a scientific study by Swedish researchers drew interest during yet another flare-up of hazardous smog.\n\nThe study, published in October in the journal Microbiome, found antibiotic-resistant genetic material in the smog but no evidence of live bacteria capable of infecting anyone.\n\nThat did not make residents of Beijing feel much better, though.\n\nThe actress Zhang Ziyi perhaps best summed up the feelings among many of Beijing\u2019s 22 million residents by writing on her Weibo account on Saturday that the smog made her want to pick up her 11-month-old daughter and fly away. Ms. Zhang worried that it \u201cmade it easier to get sick.\u201d\n\nBy Monday, most Chinese news reports speculating about the threat had been taken offline, replaced by articles quoting an unidentified expert from the city\u2019s Health Department advising that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nBut to cynical Chinese, accustomed to chronic smog and other health hazards including melamine in baby milk powder, the use of recycled  oil in restaurants and clenbuterol-fed pigs, the censorship and rebuttals merely signaled that there was, perhaps, something to worry about.\n\n\u201cSpeechless!\u201d and \u201cRun, here comes an expert!\u201d were two typical comments circulating online, now deleted.\n\n\u201cHurry and develop a face mask that keeps out harmful bacteria and superbugs,\u201d a user identified as Hengkong chushi wrote in response to an article on Tencent, titled: \u201cOfficials Respond to Beijing\u2019s Antibiotic-Resistant Smog Superbugs: No Harm to Humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just say \u2018no harm,\u2019\u201d another commenter named Sun Rain wrote. \u201cHurry up and develop new laws and new drugs, to fend off a major peril that could develop.\u201d\n\nThough fears of airborne bacteria were unfounded, there is a growing health problem of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics are heavily overprescribed in China, doctors and researchers say.\n\nThe study said \u201cvery little if anything about risks for acquiring an infection from breathing urban air,\u201d Joakim Larsson, one of the authors of the study, a professor of environmental pharmacology at the University of Gothenburg\u2019s Sahlgrenska Academy and director of its Center for Antibiotic Resistance Research, wrote in an email responding to a request for comment.\n\nIn the report, the researchers studied different locations around the world for antibiotic-resistant genes, including the human gut, the skin, wastewater, soil, pharmaceutically polluted sites and, in an apparent innovation, Beijing smog.\n\nIn what they described as \u201ca limited set of deeply sequenced air samples from a Beijing smog event,\u201d they identified about 64 types of antibiotic-resistant genes, making Beijing smog one of two environments with \u201cthe largest relative abundance and/or diversity\u201d of antibiotic-resistant genes, including genes with resistance to last-resort antibiotics. The other, already known, is environments polluted by pharmaceutical factories.\n\n\u201cWe have studied DNA from bacteria in the air and found a large variety of genes that can make bacteria resistant to antibiotics, including some of the most powerful antibiotics we have,\u201d Mr. Larsson wrote in the email. \u201cThis was a surprising finding to us, and we think it warrants further studies.\u201d\n\nOthers appeared to agree.\n\n\u201cThis is important work that may provide insights into the dissemination of antibiotic resistance not only in Beijing but in other cities as well,\u201d W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that bacteria in smog are a health threat,\u201d Dr. Lipkin wrote, noting that smog may be the more likely cause of health problems.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that the air isn\u2019t clear. Pollution results in damage to airways that increases susceptibility to a wide range of viruses as well as bacteria,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOne question not addressed is whether smog stabilizes bacteria in a way that normal air does not,\u201d he added. \u201cBacteria probably don\u2019t replicate in the air. More likely that they settle somewhere and do, exchanging genetic material in liquid or on surfaces.\u201d\n\nState news outlets are dispensing health advice: To minimize illness during smog attacks, get enough sleep, eat foods that help you expectorate, flush out your nose with saltwater and wash your hands.\n\nHeavy smog was predicted again in Beijing for three days, starting on Friday.\n", "world united end trump democracy postwar defined decades age states donald farage nigel freedom britains happen angloamerican order vision": "\nOne of the strangest episodes in Donald Trump\u2019s very weird campaign was the appearance of an Englishman looking rather pleased with himself at a rally on Aug. 24 in Jackson, Miss. The Englishman was Nigel Farage, introduced by Trump as \u201cthe Man Behind Brexit.\u201d Most people in the crowd probably didn\u2019t have a clue who Farage \u2014 the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party \u2014 actually was. Yet there he stood, grinning and hollering about \u201cour independence day\u201d and the \u201creal people,\u201d the \u201cdecent people,\u201d the \u201cordinary people\u201d who took on the banks, the liberal media and the political establishment. Trump pulled his face into a crocodile smile, clapped his hands and promised, \u201cBrexit plus plus plus!\u201d\n\nBrexit itself \u2014 the decision to withdraw Britain from the European Union, notwithstanding the almost universal opposition from British banking, business, political and intellectual elites \u2014 was not the main point here. In his rasping delivery, Trump roared about Farage\u2019s great victory, \u201cdespite horrible name-calling, despite all obstacles.\u201d Quite what name-calling he had in mind was fuzzy, but the message was clear. His own victory would be like that of the Brexiteers, only more so. He even called himself Mr. Brexit.\n\nMany friends and experts I spoke to in Britain resisted the comparison between Trumpism and Brexit. In London, the distinguished conservative historian Noel Malcolm told me that his heart sank when I compared the two. Brexit, he said, was all about sovereignty. British democracy, in his view, would be undermined if the British had to abide by laws passed by foreigners they didn\u2019t vote for. (He was referring to the European Union.) The Brexit vote, he maintained, had little to do with globalization or immigration or working-class people feeling left behind by the elites. It was primarily a matter of democratic principle.\n\nMalcolm seemed to think that Brexit voters, including former industrial workers in Britain\u2019s rust-belt cities, were moved by the same high-minded principles that had made him a convinced Brexiteer. I had my doubts. Resentment about Polish, Romanian and other European Union citizens coming to Britain to work harder for less money played an important part. As did the desire to poke the eye of an unpopular elite, held responsible for the economic stagnation in busted industrial cities. And the simple dislike of foreigners in Britain should never be underestimated.\n\nIn the United States, too, I found resistance to the idea that Brexit was a harbinger of a Trump victory. I was assured over and over by liberal friends that Trump would never be president. American voters were too sensible to fall for his hateful demagogy. Trump, I was told, was a product of peculiarly American strains of populism that flare up periodically, like the anti-immigrant nativism in the 1920s or Huey P. Long in 1930s Louisiana, but would never reach as far as the White House. Traditional American populism of this kind, directed at the rich, bankers, immigrants or big business, could, in any case, not be usefully compared with English hostility to the European Union, because there was no supranational political union the United States belonged to.\n\nAnd yet Trump and Farage quickly recognized what they shared. In Scotland, where Trump happened to be reopening a golf resort the day after the Brexit vote, he pointed out the parallels. Brexit, Trump said to the Scots who voted overwhelmingly against it, was \u201ca great thing\u201d: The British had \u201ctaken back their country.\u201d Phrases like \u201csovereignty,\u201d \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cgreatness\u201d fired up the crowds in both Trump\u2019s and Farage\u2019s campaigns. You might think they meant something different by those words. Farage and his allies, many of them English nationalists, wanted to wrest national sovereignty from the European Union. But from whom or what does Trump want to take his country back? Trump has gestured at the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization as noxious elements run by international elites to the detriment of the American working man. But I can\u2019t imagine that these institutions fill most of his followers with rage.\n\nIn fact, most international institutions, including the I.M.F. and NATO, were set up under American auspices, to promote the interests of the United States and its allies. European unification, and the resulting European Union, too, have not only been approved of but also vociferously encouraged by American presidents before Trump. But his America First sentiments \u2014 for that is what they are at this point, more than a policy \u2014 are hostile to these organizations. And so, by and large, are the likes of Nigel Farage.\n\nSo Farage and Trump were speaking about the same thing. But they have more in common than distaste for international or supranational institutions. When Farage, in his speech in Jackson, fulminated against the banks, the liberal media and the political establishment, he was not talking about foreign bodies but about the aliens in our midst, as it were, our own elites who are, by implication, not \u201creal, \u201cordinary\u201d or \u201cdecent.\u201d And not only Farage. The British prime minister, Theresa May, not a Brexiteer before the referendum, called members of international-minded elites \u201ccitizens of nowhere.\u201d When three High Court judges in Britain ruled that Parliament, and not just the prime minister\u2019s cabinet, should decide when to trigger the legal mechanism for Brexit, they were denounced in a major British tabloid newspaper as \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d\n\nTrump deliberately tapped into the same animus against citizens who are not \u201creal people.\u201d He made offensive remarks about Muslims, immigrants, refugees and Mexicans. But the deepest hostility was directed against those elitist traitors within America who supposedly coddle minorities and despise the \u201creal people.\u201d The last ad of the Trump campaign attacked what Joseph Stalin used to call \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d in a particularly insidious manner. Incendiary references to a \u201cglobal power structure\u201d that was robbing honest working people of their wealth were illustrated by pictures of George Soros, Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein. Perhaps not every Trump supporter realized that all three are Jewish. But those who did cannot have missed the implications.\n\nWhen Trump and Farage stood on that stage together in Mississippi, they spoke as though they were patriots reclaiming their great countries from foreign interests. No doubt they regard Britain and the United States as exceptional nations. But their success is dismaying precisely because it goes against a particular idea of Anglo-American exceptionalism. Not the traditional self-image of certain American and British jingoists who like to think of the United States as the City on the Hill or Britain as the sceptered isle splendidly aloof from the wicked Continent, but another kind of Anglo-American exception: the one shaped by World War II. The defeat of Germany and Japan resulted in a grand alliance, led by the United States, in the West and Asia. Pax Americana, along with a unified Europe, would keep the democratic world safe. If Trump and Farage get their way, much of that dream will be in tatters.\n\nIn the years when most of Europe was overrun by the Nazis or fascist dictatorships, the Anglo-American allies were the last hope of freedom, democracy and internationalism. I grew up in the world they shaped. My native country, the Netherlands, was freed in 1945, six years before I was born, by British and North American troops (with the help of some very brave Poles). Those of us with no direct memories of this had still seen movies like \u201cThe Longest Day,\u201d about the Normandy landings. John Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Kenneth More and his bulldog were our liberating heroes.\n\nThis was, of course, a childish conceit. For one thing, it left out the Soviet Red Army, which liberated my father, who was forced to work in a factory in Berlin along with other young men who, under German occupation, refused to sign a loyalty oath to the Nazis. But the victorious Anglo-Saxon nations, especially the United States, largely shaped the postwar Western world we lived in. The words of the Atlantic Charter, drawn up by Churchill and Roosevelt in 1941, resonated deeply throughout a war-torn Europe: Trade barriers would be lowered, peoples would be free, social welfare would advance and global cooperation would ensue. Churchill called the charter \u201cnot a law, but a star.\u201d\n\nPax Americana, in which Britain played the role of special junior partner, whose specialness was perhaps more keenly felt in London than in Washington, was based on a liberal consensus. Not only NATO, set up to protect Western democracies, chiefly against the Soviet threat, but also the ideal of European unification were born from the ashes of 1945. Many Europeans, liberals as well as conservatives, believed that only a united Europe would stop them from tearing their continent apart again. Even Winston Churchill, whose heart was more invested in Commonwealth and Empire, was in favor of it.\n\nThe Cold War made the exceptional role of the victorious allies even more vital. The West, its freedoms protected by the United States, needed a plausible counternarrative to Soviet ideology. This included a promise of greater social and economic equality. Of course, neither the United States, with its long history of racial prejudice and occasional fits of political hysteria, like McCarthyism, nor Britain, with its tenacious class system, ever quite lived up to the shining ideals they presented to the postwar world. Nonetheless, the image of exceptional Anglo-American liberty held up, not only in countries that had been occupied during the war but in the defeated nations, Germany (at least in the western half) and Japan, as well.\n\nAmerica\u2019s prestige was greatly bolstered not just by the soldiers who helped liberate Europe but also by the men and women back home who fought to make their society more equal and their democracy more inclusive. By struggling against the injustices in their own country, figures like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or the Freedom Riders or indeed President Obama kept the hope of American exceptionalism alive. As did the youth culture of the 1960s. When Vaclav Havel, the Czech dissident playwright and later president, hailed Frank Zappa, Lou Reed and the Rolling Stones as his political heroes, he was not being frivolous. Under communist oppression, the pop music of America and Britain represented freedom. Europeans born not long after World War II often professed to hate the United States, or at least its politics and wars, but the expressions of their hostility were almost entirely borrowed from America itself. Bob Dylan received this year\u2019s Nobel Prize for literature, not least because the Swedish jury of baby boomers grew up with his words of protest.\n\nThe ideal of exceptional Anglo-Saxon liberties obviously goes back much further than the aftermath of Hitler\u2019s defeat, let alone Bob Dylan and the Stones. Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s admiring account of American democracy in the 1830s is well known. Much less famous are his writings on Britain in the same period. Born soon after the French Revolution, Tocqueville was haunted by the question of why Britain, with its mighty aristocracy, was spared such an upheaval. Why did the British people not rebel? His answer was that the social system in Britain was just open enough to allow a person to hope that with hard work, ingenuity and luck, he could rise in society. The British version of the American dream: \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d may be the great American novel, but Gatsby could have existed in Britain too.\n\nIn practice, there were probably not all that many rags-to-riches stories in 19th-century Britain. But the fact that Benjamin Disraeli, the son of Sephardic Jews, could become prime minister, and an earl, no less, provided the basis for many generations in Europe to believe in Britain as an exceptional country. Jews from Russia or Lithuania, or from Germany, like my own great-grandparents, flocked to Britain as immigrants in the hope that they, too, could become English gentlemen.\n\nAnglophilia, like the American dream, may have been based on myths, but myths can be potent and long-lasting. The notion that sufficient effort and talent can beat the odds has been especially important in Britain and the United States. Anglo-American capitalism can be harsh in many ways, but because free markets are receptive to new talent and cheap labor, they have spawned the kind of societies, pragmatic and relatively open, where immigrants can thrive, the very kind that rulers of more closed, communitarian, autocratic societies tend to despise.\n\nWilhelm II, kaiser of Germany until 1918, when his country was defeated in the First World War, which he had done his best to unleash, was such a figure. Half English himself, he called England a nation of shopkeepers and described it as \u201cJuda-England,\u201d a country corrupted by sinister alien elites, where money counted more than the virtues of blood and soil. In later decades, this kind of anti-Semitic rhetoric was more often aimed at the United States. The Nazis were convinced that Jewish capitalists ruled America, not just in Hollywood but in Washington and, naturally, New York. This notion is still commonly held, though less in Europe than in the Middle East and some parts of Asia. But talk about \u201ccitizens of nowhere,\u201d sinister cosmopolitan elites and conspiratorial bankers fits precisely in the same tradition. A terrifying irony of contemporary Anglo-American populism is the common use of phrases that were traditionally used by enemies of the English-speaking countries.\n\nYet even those who don\u2019t go along with the kaiser\u2019s loathsome words recognize that liberal economics, as practiced since the middle of the 19th century in Britain and the United States, has a darker side. It does not allow for much redistribution of wealth or protection of the most vulnerable citizens. There have been exceptions: Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, for instance, or Britain\u2019s postwar Labor government under Clement Attlee, which created free national health care, built better public housing, improved education and guaranteed other blessings of the welfare state. British working-class men who risked their lives for their country during the war expected no less. On the whole, however, Britain and the United States have, compared with many Western countries, generally set greater store on individual economic freedom than on the ideal of egalitarianism. And nothing creates such swift and radical social change as unfettered free enterprise.\n\nThe Reagan-Thatcher revolution in the 1980s \u2014 deregulating financial services, closing down coal mines and manufacturing plants and hacking away at the benefits of the New Deal and the British welfare state \u2014 was regarded by many conservatives, on both sides of the Atlantic, as a triumph for Anglo-American exceptionalism, a great coup for freedom. Europeans outside Britain were more skeptical. They tended to see Thatcherism and Reaganomics as ruthless forms of economic liberalism, making some people vastly richer but leaving many more out in the cold. Nonetheless, in order to compete, many governments began to emulate the same economic system.\n\nThat this happened at the end of the Cold War was no coincidence. The collapse of Soviet communism was celebrated, rightly, as the final liberation of Europe. Countries, left behind on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain after World War II, were free at last. The first President Bush spoke about the \u201cnew world order,\u201d led by the only superpower left standing. The Reagan-Thatcher revolution appeared to have triumphed.\n\nBut the end of communism in the West also had other, less desirable consequences. The horrors of the Soviet empire tainted other forms of leftism, including social democratic ideals, which in fact had been anti-communist. Even as the \u201cend of history\u201d was declared and the Anglo-American liberal democratic model was expected to be unrivaled forever, many began to believe that all forms of collectivist idealism led straight to the gulag. Thatcher once declared that there was no such thing as society, just individuals and families. People had to be forced to take care of themselves.\n\nRadical economic liberalism did more to destroy traditional communities than any social-democratic governments ever did. Thatcher\u2019s most implacable enemies were the miners and industrial workers. The neoliberal rhetoric was all about prosperity \u201ctrickling down\u201d from above. But it never quite worked out that way. Those workers and their children, now languishing in impoverished rust-belt cities, received another blow in the banking crisis of 2008. Major postwar institutions, like the I.M.F., which the United States set up in 1945 to secure a more stable world, no longer functioned properly. The I.M.F. did not even see the crisis coming. Large numbers of people, who never recovered from the crash, decided to rebel and voted for Brexit \u2014 and for Trump.\n\nNeither Brexit nor Trump are likely to bring great benefits to these voters. But at least for a while, they can dream of taking their countries back to an imaginary, purer, more wholesome past. This reaction is not only sweeping across the United States and Britain. The same thing is happening in other countries, including some with long liberal democratic traditions, like the Netherlands. Twenty years ago, Amsterdam was seen as the capital of everything wild and progressive, the kind of place where cops openly smoke pot (another myth, but a telling one). The Dutch thought of themselves as the world champions of racial and religious tolerance. Of all European countries, the Netherlands was the most firmly embedded in the Anglosphere. Now the most popular political party, according to the latest polls, is led practically as a one-man operation by Geert Wilders, an anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-European Union firebrand who hailed Trump\u2019s victory as the coming of a \u201cpatriotic spring.\u201d\n\nIn France, Marine Le Pen, who shares Wilders\u2019s enthusiasm for Trump, might be the next president. Poland and Hungary are already ruled by populist autocrats who reject the kind of liberalism that Eastern European dissidents once struggled so hard to achieve. Norbert Hofer, a man of the far right, could become the next president of Austria.\n\nDoes this mean that Britain and the United States are no longer exceptional? Perhaps. But I think it is also true to say that the very idea of Anglo-American exceptionalism has made populism in those countries more potent. The self-flattering notion that the Western victors in World War II are special, braver and freer than any other people, that the United States is the greatest nation in the history of man, that Great Britain \u2014 the country that stood alone against Hitler \u2014 is superior to any European let alone non-European country has not only led to some ill-conceived wars but also helped to paper over the inequalities built into Anglo-American capitalism. The notion of natural superiority, of the sheer luck of being born an American or a Briton, gave a sense of entitlement to people who, in terms of education or prosperity, were stuck in the lower ranks of society.\n\nThis worked quite well until the last decades of the last century. Not only were the fortunes of working- or lower-middle-class people in Britain beginning to dwindle compared with those of the rich, who were steadily getting richer, but it gradually became clear even to the most insular Britons that they were doing much worse than the Germans, the Scandinavians and the Dutch, worse even than the French, Britain\u2019s oldest rivals. One way of venting their rage was to fight in soccer stadiums, taunting German fans by mimicking British bombers and bellowing slogans about winning the war.\n\nThe so-called football hooligans remained an embarrassing minority, but there were other ways to express the same feelings. The European Union, for which most British people had never felt a great love, actually made many parts of Britain more prosperous. The blight of the old industrial cities and mining towns was not a result of European Union policies. But it was easy for \u201cEuro-skeptics\u201d to deflect popular attention from domestic problems by blaming foreigners who were supposedly running the show in Brussels. Europhobes liked to claim that \u201cthis was not why we fought the war.\u201d The specter of not just Hitler but also Napoleon was sometimes evoked. Spitfires and talk of Britain\u2019s finest hour made a rhetorical comeback in the UKIP campaign to leave Europe. Some pro-Brexit politicians even praised the greatness of the British Empire. \u201cTaking back control\u201d by leaving the European Union is not going to make most people in Britain more prosperous. The contrary is more likely to be true. But it takes the sting out of relative failure. It feeds the desire to feel exceptional, entitled, in short, to be great again.\n\nSomething similar has happened in the United States. Not only were even the least privileged Americans told that they lived in God\u2019s own country, but white Americans, however impoverished and undereducated, had the comforting sense that there was always a group beneath them, who did not share their entitlement, or claim to greatness, a class of people with a darker skin. With a Harvard-educated black president, this fiction became increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nTrump and the leaders of Brexit had a fine instinct for these popular feelings. In a way, Trump is a Gatsby gone sour. He played on the wounded pride of large communities and inflamed the passions of people who fear the changes that make them feel abandoned. In the United States, this brought out old strains of nativism. In Britain, English nationalism is the main force behind Brexit. But in both cases, \u201ctaking back our country\u201d means a retreat from the world that the Anglo-Americans envisaged after 1945. English nationalists have opted for a modern version of Splendid Isolation (paradoxically, a term coined to describe British foreign policy under Benjamin Disraeli). Trump wants to put America First.\n\nBrexit Britain and Trump\u2019s America are linked in their desire to pull down the pillars of Pax Americana and European unification. In a perverse way, this may herald a revival of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain and the United States, a case of history repeating itself not exactly as farce but as tragi-farce. Trump told Theresa May that he would like to have the same relationship with her that Ronald Reagan had with Margaret Thatcher. But the first British politician to arrive at Trump Tower to congratulate the president-elect was not the prime minister or even the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, but Nigel Farage.\n\nTrump and Farage, beaming like schoolboys in front of Trump\u2019s gilded elevator, gloated over their victories by repeating the same word that once made their respective countries exceptional: \u201cfreedom.\u201d In the privacy of Trump\u2019s home, Farage suggested that the new president should move Winston Churchill\u2019s bust back into the Oval Office. Trump thought this a splendid idea.\n\nA month before Trump\u2019s election and three months after the Brexit vote, I visited the great military historian Sir Michael Howard at his home in rural England. As a young man, Howard fought the Germans as an officer in the British Army. He landed in Italy in 1943 and took part in the decisive battle of Salerno, for which he was awarded the Military Cross. John Wayne and Kenneth More were a fantasy. Sir Michael was the real thing. He is 95 years old.\n\nAfter lunch at a local pub, just a few miles from where my grandparents used to live, we talked about Brexit, the war, American politics, Europe and our families. The setting could not have been more English, with the pale autumn sun setting over the rolling hills of Berkshire. Like my great-grandparents, Sir Michael\u2019s maternal grandparents were German Jews who moved to England, where they did very well. Like mine, his family of immigrants became utterly British. In addition to being Regius professor of history at Oxford University, Howard taught at Yale. He knows America well and has no illusions about the \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d which he believes was invented by Churchill and was always much overblown.\n\nSitting in his drawing room, with books piled up around us, many of them about World War II, I wanted to hear his thoughts on Brexit. He replied in a tone of resigned melancholy more than outrage. Brexit, he said, \u201cis accelerating the disintegration of the Western world.\u201d Contemplating that world, so carefully constructed after the war he fought in, he said: \u201cPerhaps it was just a bubble in an ocean.\u201d I asked him about the special Anglo-American relationship. \u201cAh, \u2018the special relationship,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a necessary myth, a bit like Christianity. But now where do we go?\u201d\n\nWhere indeed? The last hope of the West might be Germany, the country that Michael Howard fought against and that I hated as a child. Angela Merkel\u2019s message to Trump on the day after his victory was a perfect expression of Western values that are still worth defending. She would welcome a close cooperation with the United States, she said, but only on the basis of \u201cdemocracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views.\u201d Merkel spoke as the true heiress of the Atlantic Charter.\n\nGermany, too, once thought it was the exceptional nation. This ended in a worldwide catastrophe. The Germans learned their lesson. They no longer wanted to be exceptional in any way, which is why they were so keen to be embedded in a unified Europe. The last thing Germans wanted was to lead other countries, especially in any military sense. This is the way Germany\u2019s neighbors wished it as well. Pax Americana seemed vastly preferable to a revival of German exceptionalism. I still think so. But looking once more at that photograph of the Donald and Farage, baring their teeth in glee, thumbs held high, with the gold from the elevator door glinting in their hair, I wonder whether Germany might not be compelled to question a lesson it learned a little too well.\n", "sound brown singer debut reconcile night plaza country kane selftitled reaches irving released performed mr saturday album sides": "\nDuring the middle of his concert Saturday night at Irving Plaza, the young country singer Kane Brown told a story about meeting one of his idols, Randy Travis. Mr. Travis has one of the most convincing, haunting voices in the genre, and has been a model of stoic dignity for the last couple of decades. When they met, Mr. Brown said he asked Mr. Travis for a hug.\n\nAfter telling that story, Mr. Brown proceeded to sing \u201cThree Wooden Crosses,\u201d Mr. Travis\u2019s dark crypto-morality tale. His voice was low, meaty, resonant; his mood was somber. Just before, he had sung Craig Morgan\u2019s \u201cAlmost Home,\u201d a borderline bizarre song about the power of imagination told from the perspective of a homeless man.\n\nBoth songs were hits in 2003, when Mr. Brown, now 23, was just 10 years old, and it seems as if they helped to shape his approach to singing. At his best, his voice is viscous and rich, low and wide like a barge.\n\nAnd yet this is a hostile time in country for such a voice, and so Mr. Brown is not exactly that kind of singer, not most of the time at least. He is in the third or fourth wave of country bros who have bottlenecked Nashville in recent years, and on his self-titled debut album, which was released last week (on RCA Nashville/Zone 4), he is attempting to strike a compromise between his two selves.\n\nOn songs like \u201cAin\u2019t No Stopping Us Now,\u201d celebrating how \u201cthem lips taste like watermelon,\u201d and \u201cHometown,\u201d a deeply generic take on post-Florida Georgia Line, midtempo-rock rural boosterism, Mr. Brown\u2019s voice is thin and unenthused. These are the sorts of songs that are at this point long past clich\u00e9, and perhaps beyond parody, too.\n\nTo his credit, though, Mr. Brown seemed to understand this during his concert. While singing these songs, he looked almost bored, as if wandering around someone else\u2019s stage. Here especially, his backing band was missile-grade intense, with arrangements that were far too burly for Mr. Brown\u2019s voice. And the more punishing the music became, the more reluctant Mr. Brown was, as if looking for a place to hide.\n\nIn truth, Mr. Brown is more intriguing than energy-drink country. When he used to post country covers on YouTube, his better ones were of Lee Brice and George Strait, singers with a tough, steady affect. And during this show, Mr. Brown was eager to demonstrate his old-fashioned country bona fides. His hometown, he said, was recently voted \u201cthe fourth most boring city in Georgia,\u201d and he sang \u201cCold Spot,\u201d about the general store his father owned and operated there, while a picture of the humble store was displayed on the screen behind him.\n\nMr. Brown also has an unusual background. His rapid ascent in the last two years has taken place largely through the internet and social media, and has been scrutinized by country traditionalists looking to poke a hole in the story of his seemingly organic rise. (He was initially signed through Zone 4, an imprint affiliated with the hip-hop and R&B producer Polow Da Don.)\n\nMr. Brown\u2019s father is black and Cherokee, and his mother is white \u2014 in undiverse country music, this is still uncommon. Early in the show, he stopped to relate some of the particulars of his upbringing: \u201cWent through child abuse. Went through racism.\u201d He mentioned living in a car with his mother for a spell. He spoke about friends who used drugs and overdosed, and some who used guns and hurt themselves.\n\nThe crowd was muted during this section \u2014 perhaps it had come for the other version of Mr. Brown, the version that, twice, halfheartedly pulled up his shirt to reveal his abdominal muscles, as if he were Trey Songz.\n\nBut here, too, Mr. Brown was savvy. One of those times was during \u201cPull It Off,\u201d which he performed first. It\u2019s a moody burner, the best song on his new album, and also the one place in which his two sides are wholly reconciled \u2014 his deep voice applied to the thick, sweet molasses of seduction.\n", "meant mike gender methods vice orientation sexual conversion pence persons discredited therapy identity denied presidentelect supports change history": "\nSince Gov. Mike Pence was chosen as Donald J. Trump\u2019s running mate in July, he has faced complaints from groups critical of his record on gay and transgender rights, who said he has long been an opponent of the gains made by the L.G.B.T. community in recent years.\n\nMr. Pence has been particularly dogged by accusations that he is a supporter of \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d the practice of trying to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. It has been discredited by the medical establishment and denounced by gay and transgender groups.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s spokesman, Marc Lotter, denied to The Times over the weekend that the vice president-elect supports the practice, saying a past campaign statement had been misinterpreted. But L.G.B.T. groups remain skeptical, pointing to his record of opposition to gay rights  as a member of Congress and as governor of Indiana and an approving reference to conversion therapy in the 2016 Republican Party platform.\n\nSo, what is conversion therapy, and why is Mr. Pence so closely associated with it?\n\nThe phrases \u201cconversion therapy\u201d and \u201creparative therapy\u201d refer to discredited psychotherapy methods that aim to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. Spiritual efforts to accomplish the same goal are sometimes called \u201cex-gay ministry.\u201d\n\nConversion therapy has been condemned by a range of groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association, which said it was based on the view that homosexuality is a disorder, an idea \u201cthat has been rejected by all the major mental health professions.\u201d\n\nConversion therapy practitioners \u201coften frame the inability to change one\u2019s sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure,\u201d adding to its harmful effects, the A.P.A. said.\n\nIn the past, efforts to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation sometimes involved extreme measures like institutionalization, castration and electroshock therapy, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nToday, critics contend that conversion therapy still sometimes includes physical abuse. For example, a New Jersey organization convicted of fraud last year was accused of sexually abusing its clients and forcing them to participate in violent role-play exercises.\n\nMost practitioners, however, primarily use quasi-psychoanalytic methods like one-on-one or group therapy sessions. Rea Carey, the executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force, called it \u201cbrutal, inhuman psychological and at times physical abuse.\u201d\n\nBrothers on a Road Less Traveled, a support group for men who want to stop being attracted to other men, said its method includes developing \u201can internal sense of masculinity\u201d and \u201cdiscovering our true needs underlying some of our homosexual longings and triggers.\u201d\n\nThere are frequently religious overtones to conversion therapy, which is often promoted by groups with ties to conservative Christian organizations like Focus on the Family, which says on its website that \u201chomosexual strugglers\u201d can \u201cleave homosexuality\u201d with the help of support groups like Homosexuals Anonymous or by \u201cbecoming more like Jesus.\u201d\n\nA statement on an archived version of the website for Mr. Pence\u2019s 2000 congressional campaign has been widely interpreted as signaling his support for conversion therapy. After listing his opposition to same-sex marriage and anti-discrimination laws that protect gay people, Mr. Pence\u2019s website takes up the issue of the Ryan White Care Act, which provides federal funding for H.I.V./AIDS patients and was reauthorized by Congress that year:\n\nMr. Pence had not addressed speculation about his support for conversion therapy until last weekend, when Mr. Lotter told The Times it was \u201cpatently false\u201d that Mr. Pence \u201csupported or advocated\u201d the practice.\n\nMr. Lotter said the vice president-elect had been calling for federal funds to \u201cbe directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices\u201d during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a \u201cmischaracterization\u201d to see the statement as a reference to conversion therapy.\n\nBut he declined to explain which organizations Mr. Pence had wanted to lose their federal funding or what Mr. Pence meant when he referred to groups that \u201ccelebrate and encourage\u201d activity that spreads H.I.V. Gay and transgender groups see that language as a reference to their community.\n\n\u201cThat is very specific language \u2014 some might call it a dog whistle \u2014 that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs,\u201d Ms. Carey said. \u201cParticularly the phrase \u2018seeking to change their sexual behavior,\u2019 to me, is code for conversion therapy.\u201d\n\nConversion therapy was tacitly endorsed in the Republican Party platform for the first time this year in a line that supported the \u201cright of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children.\u201d\n\nReince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican Party and the incoming White House chief of staff, told reporters  that the language did not refer to conversion therapy, but gay and transgender groups did not believe him.\n\nGregory T. Angelo, the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, an L.G.B.T. conservative group, said in an interview the nod to conversion therapy was included at the urging of Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, which has been called an anti-L.G.B.T. extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\u201cThere are only two types of therapies for minors that are notable and that are controversial at present,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is ex-gay conversion therapy and the other is transgender hormone therapy, and I hardly believe that Tony Perkins was putting a plank in the Republican Party platform endorsing the rights of parents to provide their children with transgender hormone therapy.\u201d\n\n(The Family Research Council has said it was able to establish its Washington office only with the financial assistance of the family of Betsy DeVos, whom Donald J. Trump named education secretary last week.)\n\nA coalition of former leaders of the ex-gay movement wrote an open letter in July denouncing the platform as \u201cessentially affirming\u201d conversion therapy. They said they could \u201cattest to the emotional and spiritual damage caused to men, women, children and their families\u201d by the practice.\n\nThe Republican position differs sharply from the Democrats\u2019. President Obama called for an end of conversion therapy for minors in 2015 after a 17-year-old transgender girl, Leelah Alcorn, killed herself after leaving a suicide note that talked about her time in conversion therapy.\n\nState-licensed mental health professionals have been barred from attempting to change a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity in six states: California, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Oregon and Illinois, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\n\nIt said similar laws had been passed in several municipalities, including Seattle, Washington, Cincinnati and Miami Beach, and introduced in eight more states.\n", "participating scrambling innetwork network flawed directories extra fees charge leave patients listed coverage doctors taking shopping insurers find": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Penny Gentieu did not intend to phone 308 physicians in six different insurance plans when she started shopping for 2017 health coverage.\n\nBut a few calls suggested to Ms. Gentieu, a photographer who lives in Toledo, Ohio, that doctors listed as \u201ctaking new patients\u201d in the health plans\u2019 directories were not necessarily doing so.\n\nSurprised that information about something so central to health insurance could be so poor, she contacted almost every primary care physician listed as accepting new patients in every local plan. More than three-quarters of those doctors in her part of Ohio were in fact rejecting new patients, she found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not fair to be baited and switched,\u201d said Ms. Gentieu, who must find a new doctor because her physician of several years will not be in any available plans in her area next year. \u201cIt\u2019s just so crazy that you\u2019re presented with this big list of doctors and then you call them and you realize there\u2019s nobody there.\u201d\n\nAs consumers review their coverage and shop for 2017 insurance through the federal health law\u2019s online marketplaces during the annual open enrollment period, many of the directories they are using are outdated and inaccurate. Some doctors in the directories are not accepting new patients and some are not participating in the network, say experts, brokers and consumers. Still other physicians in the directories, who are listed as \u201cin-plan,\u201d charge patients thousands of dollars extra per year in \u201cconcierge fees\u201d to join their practices.\n\n\u201cThere continue to be inaccuracy problems,\u201d said Justin Giovannelli, a Georgetown University professor, who studies coverage under the health law. Flawed directories are \u201ca real barrier to accessing the care and accessing the insurance consumers have purchased.\u201d\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has pledged to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which created the marketplaces. But insurers\u2019 doctor lists are likely to remain a problem no matter what the law looks like, consumer advocates say.\n\nKnowing which doctors and specialists are available within a plan is critical, as patients who visit a physician outside a plan\u2019s network must pay much if not all of the cost.\n\nThe effect from flawed directories is even greater this year, as carriers have stopped offering coverage in many markets, meaning many consumers have only one or two insurers to choose from. The number of doctors and hospitals in plan networks also continues to shrink as insurers steer patients toward lower-cost narrow networks.\n\nReports of inaccuracies suggest that new federal rules to ensure reliable directories are having little effect. Starting this year, all plans sold through the marketplaces are required to \u201cpublish an up-to-date, accurate and complete provider directory\u201d or be subject to penalties or removed from the marketplace portal.\n\nBut so far no plans have been fined or kicked off the enrollment sites for having poor doctor directories, said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which would enforce the rules. A Health and Human Services Department survey of Medicare plans for those 65 and older that was released in October found errors in nearly half of the listings in doctor directories.\n\nStaci Doolin, a co-owner of a radon-testing company in Forsyth, Ill., consulted the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois physician directory in January to make sure her primary care physician was in the network and even called the insurer to double-check.\n\nThe directory was wrong. The doctor was not in the plan.\n\n\u201cI thought I was good to go, and then I get this bill and it says my insurance didn\u2019t cover anything and I owe $503,\u201d Ms. Doolin said.\n\nIt took until September to resolve the matter \u2014 but not before the office threatened to summon a bill collector. She never recovered $100 she spent on a dermatologist who was listed in the directory but who also was not part of the plan.\n\nNo comprehensive data exists on doctor directory accuracy. The health law and the Health and Human Services Department set standards for network adequacy but leave most enforcement up to states. States rarely test the lists for accuracy and often rely on consumers to report problems.\n\nBut third-party surveys frequently reveal big discrepancies. One recently published study showed as many as a fourth of the doctors listed in California directories last year for marketplace plans were not accepting new patients. About one doctor in 10 was not working for the listed practice.\n\nConsumer advocates often praise California for vigorous insurance regulation. Last year, the state fined one plan $350,000 and another $250,000 for flawed doctor directories.\n\n\u201cI have to think it\u2019s pretty much the same nationwide,\u201d said Simon Haeder, an assistant professor at West Virginia University, who led the study. \u201cInsurers have a hard time keeping these up-to-date because it costs a lot of money, and providers don\u2019t put a lot of effort on giving insurers updated information.\u201d\n\nEven doctor offices are frequently unclear about whether they participate in certain plans, say insurance brokers, who assist consumers shopping for plans.\n\nConfusion multiplies when physicians are in some networks and not others offered by the same insurer. Doctors might be part of broader plan with many choices but not part of a narrow network with nearly the same name.\n\nDirectories for specialty physicians may be even more difficult to navigate than those for primary care doctors.\n\nBrian Jarvis, who lives near Dayton, Ohio, needed an orthopedist after straining an Achilles\u2019 tendon this summer. He had to go through 17 doctors listed as accepting his marketplace plan before finding one who really did, he said.\n\nAn online tool for Florida Blue, the Blue Cross insurer in that state, does not let consumers search for anesthesiologists, who are often outside coverage networks even when their hospital is in network. Unwittingly being put under by a non-network anesthesiologist can cost patients thousands of dollars.\n\nEven insurers admit patients are ultimately on their own to navigate the directory thicket.\n\n\u201cWe recommend you contact the provider to confirm that they are in your plan and that the desired service is covered,\u201d warns the online doctor-search tool for Anthem, one of the biggest sellers of marketplace plans under the health law.\n\nFew consumers take that advice to heart like Ms. Gentieu.\n\n\u201cI was shocked at how awful the state of Ohio is for handling all of this,\u201d said Ms. Gentieu, who was concerned about having a five-year-old hip replacement monitored.\n\nShe posted results on her website and sent complaint letters to plans and the Ohio Department of Insurance. Four of the insurers did not substantially dispute Ms. Gentieu\u2019s research.\n\n\u201cWhile our findings do not exactly match those of Ms. Gentieu, we did identify issues which are being addressed,\u201d said Don Olson, a spokesman for Medical Mutual of Ohio, a health insurer in the state.\n\nMs. Gentieu found that only 15 percent of those listed as primary care doctors in one Medical Mutual network were actually primary care physicians taking new patients. Many had not accepted new patients in years. Others were specialty doctors, nurse practitioners or medical residents who had not completed their training.\n\nPhysicians often fail to tell insurers when they stop accepting patients for certain plans, Medical Mutual and other carriers said.\n\nLike the Health and Human Services Department, Ohio instituted new directory-accuracy rules this year for marketplace plans. But enforcing them is \u201cconsumer-driven,\u201d said David Hopcraft, a spokesman for the Ohio Insurance Department. The state does not check the lists until consumers report inaccuracies, one doctor at a time.\n", "shadows frozenvegetable giant bg superhero icons jaws brand drop year cue movies foods green suspensefilled fall comeback taking trailer bought": "\nMAKING frozen vegetables hip is a daunting task, but B&G Foods thinks it has just the guy to do it.\n\nThe company is bringing back the Jolly Green Giant after a long hiatus to introduce new recipes. But his comeback comes with a twist. The campaign will initially seek to create a sense of mystery by not showing the giant.\n\nB&G, which bought the more than 100-year-old Green Giant brand from General Mills for $765 million last year, is betting that the way to appeal to finicky children and picky parents is with new dishes, an old mascot and a dash of suspense.\n\nIn a minute-long trailer released in September titled \u201cThe Giant Awakens,\u201d people look to the sky, mouths agape. Cars screech to a halt, raucous children in a swimming pool fall silent and grocery bags fall to the ground. Yet the giant is visible only indirectly: through footprints in fields and shadows that fall across skyscrapers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well done,\u201d said David R. Just, professor and co-director of the Cornell Center for Behavioral Economics in Child Nutrition Programs. \u201cBy the end of it, it leaves you wondering, \u2018So what\u2019s going to happen?\u2019 I think they\u2019ve hit the right note there.\u201d\n\nDan Kelleher, the chief creative officer of the New York office of Deutsch, which B&G chose as its marketing and advertising agency for the Green Giant brand, said the \u201ccinematic\u201d element of suspense in the trailer, which mimics a fantasy or superhero movie, provided flexibility about where the ad could be shown.\n\n\u201cWe were able to air this in movie theaters as a teaser,\u201d said Jordan Greenberg, vice president and general manager of the Green Giant brand at B&G. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look like a regular commercial.\u201d\n\nMr. Just added, \u201cKids are going to love this because it looks like an ad or a preview for a movie.\u201d\n\nThe slowly unfolding narrative is a good way to reintroduce the giant to audiences that remember him and to introduce him to others, especially younger viewers, Mr. Just said.\n\n\u201cThe goal with the two teams together was to figure out how to build this brand back in a very large way,\u201d Bob Cantwell, the president and chief executive of B&G Foods, said about the Green Giant in-house group and Deutsch. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful teaser commercial. We\u2019ll probably continue to use it in some format\u201d as the campaign continues, he said.\n\nThe giant has also received some updates to keep up with the times, acquiring a selfie stick and a Spotify playlist, for instance. There is a Green Giant Instagram account, which purports to chronicle a cross-country road trip taken by the giant and his elfin buddy, Sprout. There are dozens of \u201csnapshots\u201d of landmarks and sight gags, like the giant doing triceps dips on the St. Louis Gateway Arch, but viewers won\u2019t see his face in a commercial until the campaign\u2019s reveal moment in television ads next month.\n\nMr. Cantwell said the $30 million B&G was spending on the campaign was just the beginning. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue that level of spend, if not more, as we go through 2017, 2018 and 2019 \u2014 we\u2019re going to continue to support this,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the bulk of the money is expected to be for TV ads, the campaign includes elements like mobile pop-up stands at concerts and other events where people can sample new dishes. Next year, print ads will appear in magazines like People and Real Simple.\n\n\u201cHe was always the good giant in the distance,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make him more relevant, more socially active with the consumer, and bring him into today\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nTying a new campaign to a decades-old character could be a good way to do this, industry experts say.\n\n\u201cThis whole concept of what\u2019s old is new again is something the resonates across the consumer landscape,\u201d said David Portalatin, chief food analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm.\n\n\u201cThe giant is kind of this returning superhero,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said, a story line on which future ad material will build.\n\nParents, of course, might view true heroics as getting their children to willingly gobble up vegetables, and B&G has something for them as well. \u201cThe next step is the reason why the giant\u2019s back,\u201d Mr. Kelleher said, \u201cto introduce new food products and frozen vegetables.\u201d\n\nB&G is introducing 15 new products, including roasted vegetables, mashed cauliflower and vegetable tots, which substitute ingredients like broccoli and cauliflower for the usual potatoes.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to the way consumers are eating today and what they\u2019re feeding their children,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said.\n", "zealand good spirits hospital ill tour walk pole flown astronaut aldrin buzz operator falling man moon south evacuated": "\nBuzz Aldrin, the adventurer, the former astronaut and the second person to walk on the moon, was evacuated from Antarctica on Thursday after falling ill while visiting the South Pole with a tourism group.\n\nThe National Science Foundation said in a statement that it had provided a \u201chumanitarian medical evacuation for an ailing visitor\u201d from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station to McMurdo Station, the main research facility on the coast of Antarctica. The statement said Mr. Aldrin, 86, was then flown to Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nWhite Desert, the tourism operator, said in an email that Mr. Aldrin, who was taken to a hospital, \u201ccurrently has fluid in his lungs but is responding well to antibiotics and being kept overnight for observation.\u201d It described his condition as \u201cstable\u201d and said he was in \u201cgood spirits.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier statement, the tour operator said Mr. Aldrin\u2019s condition had \u201cdeteriorated\u201d after his tourist group arrived at the South Pole.\n\n\u201cAs a precaution, following discussion between the White Desert doctor and the U.S. Antarctic Program doctor, Mr. Aldrin, accompanied by a member of his team, was evacuated on the first available flight out of the South Pole to McMurdo,\u201d it said.\n\nWhite Desert said Mr. Aldrin was then handed over to the United States Antarctic Program before his journey to New Zealand.\n\nMr. Aldrin, born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr., had for days been tweeting enthusiastically about his trip to the South Pole. On Nov. 29, he posed for a group photo in front of an airplane and announced, \u201cBuzz\u2019s Polar Penguins countdown to liftoff has commenced.\u201d\n\nIn 1969, following in the footsteps of Neil Armstrong, Mr. Aldrin walked on the moon. He is the author of several books. In his memoir, \u201cMagnificent Desolation,\u201d he recounts a period of ruinous drinking and clinical depression after his time in space. In \u201cMission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration,\u201d he advocates for a manned mission to the planet.\n", "living apartment end concert classical room saturday live music night quartet string listen": "\nThe smile that spread across my face a few seconds after the Zaffre Quartet began the rousing finale of Mozart\u2019s String Quartet in G was the first hint that I\u2019d stumbled onto something special. A few minutes later, as I glanced around my living room, my friends\u2019 toe-tapping and head-nodding confirmed I wasn\u2019t the only one enjoying the music.\n\nI barely listen to classical music, so how did a live string quartet end up in my apartment on a Saturday night?\n\nAs I scrolled through my Twitter feed last month, a tweet about Groupmuse caught my attention. Groupmuse, which specializes in what it calls \u201cclassical music house-party concerts,\u201d sees itself as offering a fairly straightforward process: Set up an event as a host, hire musicians from its site, invite friends and people who use the Groupmuse site, sit back and relax. (Or you can simply attend an event, rather than hosting.) Each attendee contributes at least $10 to compensate the performers. Millennials are Groupmuse\u2019s largest audience. Concerts are in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle, with some elsewhere, and there are plans for nationwide expansion next year.\n\n\u201cAll you need is four chairs,\u201d Sam Bodkin, the Groupmuse founder, said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo whether you\u2019re under a bridge or on top of a building, we can create the great masterworks in the history of Western culture. That makes it a scalable and flexible experience that communities everywhere can gather over.\u201d\n\nFrom hole-in-the-wall jazz clubs to experimental art shows, I regularly graze at the vast array of New York\u2019s cultural buffet. And as a young black woman, I\u2019m no stranger to navigating spaces in which I\u2019m one of just a handful of minorities. But I still sometimes feel uncomfortable in those spaces \u2014 many of them considered highbrow cultural bubbles, even the ballet, which I love and attend every season. As with the ballet, there\u2019s a perception that classical music isn\u2019t the most welcoming, and certainly not the most diverse in its performers or audience members.\n\nAdd to that the formal settings in which classical music is often presented, and you have the roots of my lack of interest. But if I didn\u2019t have to leave my couch, did I have a valid excuse not to at least consider it?\n\nI made two decisions: to invite other classical music newbies, and not to listen beforehand to any of the music that would be played. The goal was to have my ears be a blank slate, even if my mind had some preconceived notions. Mr. Bodkin, who discovered classical music at 19 in a friend\u2019s basement, offered me a few tips, highlighting the relationship between consonance and dissonance and the importance of focus and encouraging me to relinquish the idea of a linear narrative.\n\n\u201cYou do need to listen to classical music in a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be about something specific; it\u2019s about an abstract emotional journey.\u201d\n\nAny jitters quickly dissipated as the quartet began the hourlong show: two 20-minute sets and an intermission. During the performance, four of my guests (three friends and a Groupmuse newbie stranger) and I were treated to a swift lesson in Classical 101, with movements from works by Mozart, Haydn and Brahms.\n\nBefore each piece, the cellist Julia Yang gave quick talks, providing contexts for the work and insights about the composers. As it turns out, quite a bit did resonate for me. I quickly picked up parallels between the music in my living room and sequences that accompanied the ballets I loved. Having set out the drinks before the show, playing hostess was a breeze, and not having to spend the usual energy on my attire (I opted for leggings and a long sweater) meant I could put the focus where it needed to be: on the music. However, it was the radical proximity of the guests and performers that made the evening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about classical music as emotional and soulful, and I don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve if I was sitting in a different environment,\u201d my friend Reginald Scott told me.\n\nDuring intermission, the violinist Zenas Hsu said, \u201cYou\u2019re not elevated on the stage, so there\u2019s definitely a deeper connection.\u201d After the performance, the quartet stayed to talk, a stark departure from the usual rush out the concert-hall doors and into the subway.\n\nOrchestras and other classical-music institutions must cultivate the next generation of loyal patrons if they are to remain culturally relevant and financially stable. Their pitches land in the email inboxes of millennials like myself on a regular basis: Join a young patrons group and receive insider perks. In all of their appeals, there\u2019s a constant: You have to go to them. Groupmuse works because, like many apps and tech start-ups, it has shifted (and in some cases inverted) ideas around the delivery and consumption of goods and services. Not so different than Spotify, here, the music comes right to you.\n\n\u201cContemporary classical music patrons have done an absolutely invaluable service in preserving this art form, but institutional change is hard,\u201d Mr. Bodkin said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating the next generation of classical music listeners and the New York Philharmonic will be there to benefit from that.\u201d\n\nAs my concert evening drew to a close and I cleared away the wine glasses, I was already thinking about hosting another Groupmuse. And who knows, maybe I\u2019ll get dressed up and see a show at Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall. For now, though, I\u2019ll start with a Spotify playlist.\n", "executed bennett charted create reruns tv robert ambitious dies local big time hours airing made stations programming broadcaster profits mr original vision": "\nRobert Bennett, who guided the transformation of a Boston television station into an uncommon font of original programming and went on to run the nation\u2019s largest broadcast station group, died on Tuesday in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 89.\n\nMr. Bennett\u2019s death was confirmed by Paul Rich, a longtime friend and business partner.\n\nIn 1971, Mr. Bennett was overseeing WNEW-TV, a successful local station in New York City, but, as he later recalled, he was getting bored. \u201cI was very anxious to do more live television,\u201d he told The New York Times in a 1981 interview. And a new opportunity arose.\n\nA group in Boston was trying to gain control of the license for Channel 5, which was then WHDH, and promised to create 50 hours of original programming each week. Mr. Bennett joined the group, Boston Broadcasters Inc., after securing a guarantee of creative control and an ownership stake in the station should it be granted the license.\n\nIn 1972, Boston Broadcasters acquired the station, WHDH became WCVB and Mr. Bennett began work to make good on the group\u2019s promise of original programming.\n\nWhile other local stations were making big profits carrying reruns, Mr. Bennett turned to homegrown content. Although it was an ABC affiliate, the station far surpassed its promise on original programming, broadcasting as much as 62 hours each week \u2014 about 30 percent of its content \u2014 at a time when most local stations devoted less than 10 percent of their airtime to shows produced in-house.\n\nWCVB\u2019s projects included \u201cSummer Solstice,\u201d a made-for-television movie starring Henry Fonda, and \u201cMiller\u2019s Court,\u201d a weekly talk show hosted by the Harvard law professor Arthur R. Miller.\n\nIn many cases, the station was able to produce shows for less than the cost of licensing reruns. WCVB made episodes of \u201cPark Street Under\u201d \u2014 a situation comedy about a Boston bar that was said to have inspired the NBC hit \u201cCheers\u201d \u2014 for $10,000 each. The going rate for \u201cLaverne & Shirley\u201d reruns at that time was $30,000 each.\n\nMany WCVB shows went into syndication, and Boston Broadcasters eventually opened a division dedicated to selling the station\u2019s content worldwide.\n\nDuring Mr. Bennett\u2019s tenure at the station, the influential television producer Norman Lear, who worked with him on syndicating the WCVB show \u201cThe Baxters,\u201d told The Times, \u201cBob has to be the best local broadcaster in the nation.\u201d By 1981, the station\u2019s profitability was said to be competitive with that of most major television stations.\n\nLater that year, WCVB was sold to Metromedia, then the nation\u2019s largest broadcast station group, for $220 million, a record sum for the sale of a local TV station at the time.\n\nAfter the sale, Mr. Bennett became president of Metromedia Broadcasting and a partner in Metromedia Inc. From 1983 to 1985, he ran the company\u2019s station group.\n\nRobert Martin Bennett was born on April 17, 1927, in Pittsburgh. After graduating from Staunton Military Academy in 1946, he served in the Army and subsequently took courses at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California, although he did not receive a degree from either.\n\nHe began his broadcast career in 1948 as a page at CBS Radio in Hollywood. In 1952, he joined KTTV in Los Angeles as a salesman, eventually rising to vice president and director of sales, a position he held from 1958 to 1966. The station was acquired by Metromedia during his tenure.\n\nMr. Bennett went on to become vice president and general manager of Metromedia\u2019s Washington station, WTTG. In 1969, he moved to WNEW, another Metromedia property.\n\nHis association with WCVB and Metromedia ended in 1985, when Rupert Murdoch acquired Metromedia\u2019s properties, which would eventually be the foundation of the Fox network.\n\nMr. Bennett then became the head of television station acquisitions for New World Entertainment. He went on to hold positions in a variety of media and real estate ventures, including chairman of Bennett Productions, run by his son, Casey.\n\nHis son survives him, as do his wife of 66 years, the former Marjie Albright; a daughter, Kelly Bennett; and a grandson. He lived in Newport Beach.\n\nDescribing the impact of WCVB in its formative years, Mr. Lear in 1981 praised Mr. Bennett for producing programming that helped viewers understand the world around them. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier for station executives to push a button than develop new material,\u201d he said. \u201cIf WCVB is winning in the numbers, then they\u2019re proof that caring pays off.\u201d\n", "rosetta agency end space friday mission landing ending spacecraft pursuit found comet european": "\nFor two years, the Rosetta spacecraft has been playing around with a comet shaped like a rubber ducky.\n\nWhen the spacecraft makes a gentle belly flop onto the comet on Friday, it will bring to an end to the most ambitious mission ever for the European Space Agency. Since its arrival in August 2014 at Comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko, Rosetta has been sending reams of data and exquisite photographs of the comet, providing insights and surprises about one of the fragments left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago.\n\nOn impact, Rosetta will switch off its radio transmitter, leaving silence at the end of its 12-year journey.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we lose contact with the spacecraft, that\u2019s the end of Rosetta,\u201d said Matt Taylor, the mission\u2019s project scientist. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice appropriate line to be drawn, I think.\u201d\n\nBack in November 2014, Rosetta dispatched a small lander, Philae, to the surface of Comet 67P.\n\nAnd as the comet has been moving away from the sun, Rosetta\u2019s solar panels were becoming less and less able to generate enough energy to power the spacecraft, and the amount of data the spacecraft could send back has been dropping.\n\nWhile it was possible to shift Rosetta into a hibernating phase, mission managers calculated that the odds were slim that Rosetta could revive when Comet 67P approached the sun again, about four years from now.\n\nInstead, they decided to undertake some truly close-up observations as Rosetta began falling into the comet.\n\nAfter Rosetta lands, with no more data coming back, mission controllers will never know the craft\u2019s exact fate.\n\nShutting off the transmitter avoids any possibility of Rosetta\u2019s interfering with the deep space communications of other spacecraft. And even if the transmitter were kept on, the antenna would almost certainly be jostled away from Earth by the impact of the landing.\n\n\u201cWe will not be able to communicate in any case,\u201d said Patrick Martin, the mission manager.\n\nThen everyone working on the mission will have some time to relax. \u201cI\u2019m going to put my feet up,\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cWe have free time, as it were.\u201d\n\nThere is still much work to do. Archiving all of the data will take three years, Dr. Martin said. \u201cNot as intense as missions operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scientists will also finally have time to analyze what they have collected. \u201cWe\u2019ve only touched the tip of the iceberg in terms of digging through the data,\u201d said Joel Parker, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and deputy principal investigator for an ultraviolet spectrograph on Rosetta. \u201cIt\u2019s been so busy doing operations that a lot of us haven\u2019t even had a chance to dig into our own instrument data as much as we would like.\u201d\n\nHere is some of what has already come out of Rosetta.\n\nThe first surprise from the initial images of Comet 67P was that it was not round \u2014 it looked more like a rubber ducky. That immediately raised the question whether the strange shape was the result of erosion or whether it was originally two comets that bumped into each other and stuck.\n\nExposed plateaus on the surface provide an important clue that Comet 67P was originally two comets. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to looking at the skin of an onion,\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cLooking at the orientation of these layers, it\u2019s clear this has to be two objects that have collided.\u201d\n\nThat in turn has additional implications on how the interior is packed together and how much it could have heated.\n\nRosetta\u2019s cameras have also captured what scientists called \u201cgoose bumps,\u201d objects about a yard wide that are the building blocks of the comet. \u201cThis is one of the major things that came out of Rosetta, this aspect of how the comet was put together,\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cIt means comets are much more puzzling that we expected.\u201d\n\nIn Rosetta\u2019s early observations, Rosetta scientists were puzzled by the lack of much ice on the comet\u2019s surface. After all, comets have long been known as \u201cdirty ice balls.\u201d\n\nComet 67P is not a particularly bright comet. Even when it reached its closest proximity to the sun, in August last year, it was not visible to the naked eye by people on Earth. But as expected, the comet became much more active. As the comet spun around once every 12 hours, frost formed and disappeared on parts of the comet. Periodically, jets of gas and dust erupted.\n\nDr. Taylor said that it appeared that dust on the surface acted as insulation, holding onto the heat during the day that warms ice below, producing gases that rise to the cold surface, freezing again as frost.\n\nThe jets appear to be the consequence of cliff walls crumbling, exposing ice that then quickly vaporized.\n\nThe bursts released so much dust that Rosetta\u2019s star trackers, cameras that keep track of the spacecraft\u2019s position by looking at the background of stars, were confused. After that, the mission managers moved Rosetta farther away from the comet. \u201cWe had to change the way we ran the mission,\u201d Dr. Martin said. \u201cThis was my main challenge.\u201d\n\nDr. Parker said that not all dust from Comet 67P was the same. Some particles are fluffy and fragile, and others are more solid pieces. \u201cThese different kinds of dust seem to come from different processes,\u201d he said. The fluffy dust comes from all over the comet, he said, while the consolidated particles seem to come from specific regions.\n\nWith the comet now much quieter, Rosetta has moved closer, within 1.2 miles of the surface.\n\n\u201cEverything is going well in this final phase of Rosetta,\u201d Dr. Martin said. \u201cThe spacecraft hardware is in rather good condition.\u201d\n\nWhere did the water in Earth\u2019s oceans came from? No one knows.\n\nBut scientists now know for sure that it did not come from comets like Comet 67P. Rosetta measured the fraction of deuterium \u2014 a heavy form of hydrogen \u2014 in the stream of water molecules coming off, and it was much higher than that found in Earth\u2019s water.\n\nThe current six-and-a-half-year orbit of Comet 67P takes it as far out as Jupiter and even at its closest approach to the sun, it is still outside Earth\u2019s orbit. Planetary scientists are sure Comet 67P originated much farther away, beyond Neptune\u2019s orbit, in what is known as the Kuiper belt, and was nudged into the inner solar system, probably by a collision or close gravitational interaction with another object.\n\nThe presence of molecular oxygen, for example, suggests that the comet formed in a very cold region. \u201cIt was fully unexpected,\u201d Dr. Taylor said. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to get oxygen because it likes to do stuff with other things. It\u2019s a very friendly molecule, and it likes to jump and become something else.\u201d\n\nThe water finding suggests that Kuiper belt comets are not the source of Earth\u2019s water.\n\nThe Philae lander, which bounded to the comet\u2019s surface in November 2014, was a resounding success and a failure. Mission managers celebrated when the lander touched the surface, but were then puzzled when it appeared to still be rotating.\n\nTwo systems designed to keep Philae pressed to the surface \u2014 harpoons and a thruster \u2014 failed, and the lander bounced high before coming back down. The lander operated for a couple of days before its battery drained. Philae briefly revived a couple of times as the comet neared the sun, then was never heard from again.\n\nNo one was quite sure where Philae ended up until this month, on the very last opportunity, Rosetta finally managed to capture a photograph of Philae on the surface.\n\nWith the exact location, scientists will be able to refine the results of an experiment that sent radio transmissions through the comet. \u201cThat will really nail their results,\u201d Dr. Taylor said.\n\nIn the final days, Rosetta is being moved into orbits that are more elliptical. One final maneuver will put it on a collision course with Comet 67P, the minuscule gravity pulling the spacecraft for a final embrace.\n\nThe landing site is on the head portion of the comet, near some intriguing pits. The aim is not to land in one of the pits, just to pass over them, but it is possible that Rosetta will end up in one of them.\n\nDr. Martin said he was ambivalent as Rosetta approached its end. \u201cI\u2019ll be very sad, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will celebrate the achievement of such an exciting mission.\u201d\n\nDr. Parker said the scientists got what they came for. \u201cWe had high hopes, and it went even higher than that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild ride.\u201d\n", "bomb estate economic coastal wary setting adapt struggling real risk perils change potential buying areas climate industry homeowners swamp time growing property": "\nMIAMI \u2014 Real estate agents looking to sell coastal properties usually focus on one thing: how close the home is to the water\u2019s edge.

Though demand remains strong and developers continue to build near the water in many coastal cities, homeowners across the nation are slowly growing wary of buying property in areas most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n\nA warming planet has already forced a number of industries \u2014 coal, oil, agriculture and utilities among them \u2014 to account for potential future costs of a changed climate. The real estate industry, particularly along the vulnerable coastlines, is slowly awakening to the need to factor in the risks of catastrophic damage from climate change, including that wrought by rising seas and storm-driven flooding.\n\nBut many economists say that this reckoning needs to happen much faster and that home buyers urgently need to be better informed. Some analysts say the economic impact of a collapse in the waterfront property market could surpass that of the bursting dot-com and real estate bubbles of 2000 and 2008.\n\nThe fallout would be felt by property owners, developers, real estate lenders and the financial institutions that bundle and resell mortgages.\n\nOver the past five years, home sales in flood-prone areas grew about 25 percent less quickly than in counties that do not typically flood, according to county-by-county data from Attom Data Solutions, the parent company of RealtyTrac. Many coastal residents are rethinking their investments and heading for safer ground.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how this town is going to defeat the water,\u201d said Brent Dixon, a resident of Miami Beach who plans to move north and away from the coast in anticipation of worsening king tides, the highest predicted tide of the year. \u201cThe water always wins.\u201d\n\nThese concerns have taken on a new urgency since the presidential election of Donald J. Trump, who has long been a skeptic of global warming, claiming in 2012 that it was a concept \u201ccreated by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.\u201d\n\nA real estate developer, Mr. Trump is also the owner of several South Florida properties, including Mar-a-Lago, a 20-acre site that stretches between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Beach.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s recent  selection of Myron Ebell to lead his Environmental Protection Agency transition team intensified these worries in Florida and among many climate scientists. Mr. Ebell has helped lead the charge against the scientific consensus that global warming exists and is caused by people.\n\nState lawmakers in Massachusetts and New Jersey are pushing to impose new rules on real estate agents and others, obligating them to disclose climate-related damage like previous flooding.\n\nBanks and insurers need to protect their collateral and investors more by improving their methods for estimating climate-change risks and creating more standardized rules for reporting them publicly, economists warn.\n\nIn April, Sean Becketti, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage giant, issued a dire prediction. It is only a matter of time, he wrote, before sea level rise and storm surges become so unbearable along the coast that people will leave, ditching their mortgages and potentially triggering another housing meltdown \u2014 except this time, it would be unlikely that these housing prices would ever recover.\n\n\u201cSome residents will cash out early and suffer minimal losses,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOthers will not be so lucky.\u201d\n\nMuch of the uncertainty surrounding climate change focuses on the pace of the rise in sea levels. But some argue that this misses the point because property values will probably go under water long before the properties themselves do.\n\nWhat is often called \u201cnuisance\u201d flooding \u2014 inundation caused more by tides than weather \u2014 is already affecting property values. Often just a foot or two deep, this type of flooding can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars and contaminate groundwater.\n\nFlorida has six of the 10 American urban centers most vulnerable to storm surge, according to a 2016 report from CoreLogic, a real estate data firm. Southeast Florida experiences about 10 tidal floods per year now. That number is likely to be around 240 floods per year by 2045, according to climate researchers.\n\nIn the past year, home sales have increased 2.6 percent nationally, but have dropped about 7.6 percent in high-risk flood zones in Miami-Dade County, according to housing data. Many coastal cities are taking steps toward mitigation, digging runoff tunnels, elevating roads and building detention ponds.\n\nJames Murley, Miami-Dade\u2019s chief resilience officer, said it was important to avoid spooking the market since real estate investment produces much of the revenue that pays for these upgrades. This balancing act is especially important in Florida because the state and localities rely heavily on property and sales taxes for funding such projects.\n\nFlorida is not alone. Forty percent of Americans live and work in coastal areas, and those who can afford it are protecting their investments by building private bulkheads and lifting their homes onto stilts. But skeptics question the logic of upgrading individual properties if the surrounding areas do not keep pace and flooding or the rise in sea levels swamps nearby roads.\n\nFor many home buyers and owners, the cost of flood insurance  is a growing worry. As premiums rise, property values fall, a trend already hurting home prices in places like Atlantic City, Norfolk, Va., and St. Petersburg, Fla., according to local real estate agents.\n\nRoy and Carol Baker, who now live in Sarasota, Fla., recalled trying for several months to sell their home in nearby Siesta Key in 2014. Interested buyers kept backing out of the purchase when they found out that the annual flood insurance premium was roughly $7,000, they said.\n\nThis experience will become more common, economists say, as the federal government shifts away from subsidizing flood insurance rates to get premiums closer to reflecting the true market cost of the risk.\n\nAs difficult as it is to predict the pace of climate change, modeling how it will affect the real estate market is even more complicated. Like a game of hot potato, builders, homeowners, banks, flood insurers and buyers of securitized mortgages try to hand off risky properties before getting burned. Developers erect houses and sell them typically within a couple of years, long before their investments depreciate. Banks earn commissions even on risky home loans before bundling these mortgages into securities and selling them to large pension funds, insurers or other buyers.\n\nHome buyers tend to think short term, focus on what they can afford and hope that the local infrastructure keeps pace with the rise in sea levels. Home buyers are also generally on their own as they look at prospective properties and try to size up their risk, as real estate agents vary in what they disclose.\n\nMost real estate agents say they try to tackle the issue head-on, providing clients with maps indicating federally declared high-risk flood zones, and using climate-change preparedness as a selling point, emphasizing if the house has a backup generator or shingles that can withstand hurricane-strength winds.\n\nBut real estate agents risk putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage by overstating threats. Good information is hard to come by. No one knows whether, when or by how much properties will depreciate, seas will encroach or flood insurance policies will change.\n\nValerie Amor, a real estate agent in Fort Lauderdale, said that, unlike most in her industry, she does a feasibility study before she assists in either buying or selling property.\n\n\u201cIt should not be left as a moral or personal decision,\u201d said Ms. Amor, adding that more disclosure should be mandatory.\n\nNorfolk is a city surrounded by water. In 2014, the Federal Emergency Management Agency expanded the area designated as highest risk for a flood in an update to regional maps, requiring thousands of new homeowners to have flood insurance. The real estate industry worried about the impact on the market. Lawmakers responded.\n\nThe region around Norfolk has among the highest rates of annual sea level rise on the East Coast. Rising water and sinking land could push the relative sea level up in some parts by six feet by the end of the century, the United States Army Corps of Engineers estimates. Flood insurance in moderate- to low-risk areas nationally costs more than $200 a year, according to the National Flood Insurance Program, but for properties in flood zones, those rates could rise by as much as several thousand dollars.\n\nVirginia requires real estate agents to reveal whether a property is in a military airplane noise zone, has defective drywall or has ever been used to manufacture methamphetamine. After the flood maps were updated, the industry wondered what new disclosure rules would be mandated. Should homeowners or their agents be required to reveal to potential buyers if the house had been flooded? Should they have to tell how much flood insurance cost and was estimated to rise?\n\nWithin a year, state lawmakers passed a real estate disclosure law that the industry hailed as a major step forward. \u201cWe are immensely satisfied,\u201d Deborah Baisden, then president of the Virginia Association of Realtors, said of the law.\n\nWhile the law encourages home buyers to exert due diligence in investigating the risk of living in a flood hazard area, it also explicitly states that the seller of a home is not obligated to disclose whether the home is in a zone that FEMA regards as high risk.\n\nSome city officials said the law did not go far enough. \u201cIt\u2019s a nondisclosure disclosure,\u201d Meg Pittenger, an environmental manager for the city of Portsmouth, Va., told  a  reporter for The Virginian-Pilot. She added that it should have required sellers or agents to inform prospective buyers whether a property lies in a flood zone.\n\nFlood risks are easily overlooked because past flood damage often goes unreported and, as in Virginia, the burden of discovering it falls to the buyer. LexisNexis, a news and legal research company, can supply sellers a report with the history of flood claims on the property, but buyers usually do not know to ask for it. FEMA collects information on federal insurance claims for homes nationally, but the agency has been reluctant to make it public for privacy reasons.\n\nStates and local real estate agents are handling disclosure differently. In Florida, real estate agents have to notify purchasers if a property is subject to natural hazards, but the law applies only to a limited area along the Florida coast and has no penalties for noncompliance. And in 2010 lawmakers stripped the requirement to disclose a property\u2019s windstorm mitigation rating.\n\nCalifornia, Washington and Pennsylvania, on the other hand, require the disclosure of past flooding or susceptibility to future flooding. In New York, sellers are required to disclose whether a property sits in a flood plain. \u201cIt may be a matter of life and death,\u201d said State Senator Stewart Greenleaf of Pennsylvania, who sponsored a state disclosure rule that became law this year.\n\nSome real estate agents around Boston have begun taking prospective buyers to newly repaired multimillion-dollar sea walls built to protect homes from storm damage. They also have begun to encourage clients to increase the marketability of their properties by installing storm-resistant technology, including steel beams and window flaps that allow water to flow in and out of a basement during a flood.\n\nNot everyone favors more disclosure, said Daren Blomquist, the senior vice president of communications at Attom Data Solutions, the real estate data tracking firm that serves brokers, lenders and insurers. After strong objections from real estate companies, which threatened to stop providing data, his firm took down its web page that integrated real estate listings with plot-by-plot information about the risks of floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural hazards.\n\n\u201cThe pressure was intense,\u201d he said, adding that the company still provides this information on separate web pages.\n\nIt is not just property owners, buyers and sellers who are struggling to estimate the potential financial impact of climate change on the real estate market. These risks compound as individual mortgages get bundled and sold as securities. In his April report, Mr. Becketti, the Freddie Mac economist, emphasized how difficult it was to predict whether the bubble in coastal real estate would slowly deflate or suddenly pop.\n\n\u201cWill the value of the house decline gradually as the expected life of the house becomes shorter?\u201d he wrote. \u201cOr, alternatively, will the value of the house \u2014 and all the houses around it \u2014 plunge the first time a lender refuses to make a mortgage on a nearby house or an insurer refuses to issue a homeowner\u2019s policy?\u201d\n\nThe real estate and mortgage markets have been slow to confront climate change, said Albert Slap, an environmental lawyer and the president of Coastal Risk Consulting, a company that advises communities on how to prepare for sea level rise. Most buyers of securities, for example, underestimate the risk in their portfolios by relying on FEMA flood maps, he said. Strictly backward looking, these maps are based on floods that have already occurred.\n\nTo make matters worse, the National Flood Insurance Program is more than $20 billion in debt. After several major coastal storms, Congress tried to fix the program, passing a law in 2012 requiring that insurance premiums be recalculated to accurately reflect risk. Coastal homeowners rebelled, arguing that the legislation made insurance unaffordable, and in 2014 Congress repealed parts of the law.\n\nGeorge Kasimos, a real estate expert in Toms River, N.J., said homeowners had good reason to react. \u201cA homeowner may be approved for a $300,000 mortgage with a $3,000 a year flood insurance premium,\u201d he said, but the same person\u2019s loan application would most likely be rejected with a $10,000 flood insurance premium. As insurance prices rise, some home purchases will become cash only, squeezing more middle-class and lower-income buyers out of the market.\n\nThe North Carolina shore has been especially popular among baby boomers along the East Coast looking for an affordable retirement option.\n\nDavid Jacobs, 54, said he expected that his home \u2014 about 50 feet from the water in Wrightsville Beach, N.C. \u2014 will be washed away soon enough. \u201cIt pains me to think my children and grandchildren may not be able to enjoy it,\u201d he said, adding that his flood insurance is now about $400 more per month than it was when he moved there in 2013.\n\nEconomists have also called for reporting rules so securities investors would know what portion of their bundled mortgages includes high risk from climate change, like properties in coastal regions, river flood plains, flammable canyons and mountainsides, earthquake zones, tsunami washout zones and tornado alleys.\n\n\u201cCoastal mortgages are growing into as big a bubble as the housing market of 2007,\u201d said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. But this time, he said, there will not be a rebound because the waters will not recede and properties will eventually lose all of their value.\n\nPoliticians are more focused on keeping developers calm and reassuring people that technological solutions will save the day, he said, which plays into an expectation, especially among the wealthiest homeowners, that the government will bail them out if property values crash.\n\nCoastal homeowners are reluctant to leave. Robert Meyer, the co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has been using web surveys to assess the willingness of South Florida residents to pay higher taxes for climate-change upgrades rather than move.\n\n\u201cThey show a remarkable willingness to stick it out,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. His study found that by 2050 people would still be living in the riskiest areas and would have incrementally paid billions of dollars for adaptation measures.\n\nDespite the slowdown in home sales, many flood-prone cities are still growing. Skyscrapers and new apartment buildings are going up all around Fort Lauderdale. The local chamber of commerce says the city expects to add about 50,000 people in the next 15 years and currently lacks housing to accommodate them. In Miami, much of the new construction consists of luxury condos aimed at a large number of cash buyers from Russia and Latin America.\n\nNationally, median home prices in areas at high risk for flooding are still 4.4 percent below what they were 10 years ago, while home prices in low-risk areas are up 29.7 percent over the same period, according to the housing data.\n\nChris Bergh, the South Florida conservation director at the Nature Conservancy, said he was worried because his house on Big Pine Key was just over a half-mile from the beach and only about five feet above sea level.\n\n\u201cIn planning for my 7-year-old child\u2019s future,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t count on him inheriting a valuable piece of property on Big Pine Key.\u201d\n", "homes bars tobacco nationwide apartments housing city cover effect rule early york officials offices common ban smoking residents public areas": "\nSmoking will be prohibited in public housing residences nationwide under a federal rule announced on Wednesday.\n\nOfficials with the Department of Housing and Urban Development said that the rule would take effect early next year, but that public housing agencies would have a year and a half to put smoke-free policies in place. The rule will affect more than 1.2 million households, the officials said, although some 200,000 homes already come under smoking bans adopted voluntarily by hundreds of public housing agencies around the country.\n\nThe nationwide ban will have its greatest impact in New York, where the New York City Housing Authority \u2014 whose 178,000 apartments and more than 400,000 residents make it the largest public housing agency in the United States, has lagged behind many of its counterparts in adopting smoke-free policies. While HUD proposed the sweeping prohibition a year ago, it had been prodding public housing authorities to adopt such policies since 2009.\n\nThe New York agency, which had asked HUD unsuccessfully for three years to phase in a ban, issued a statement on Wednesday saying it was \u201cfully committed to providing an environment that promotes resident health as part of our vision of safe, clean and connected communities.\u201d\n\nAnti-smoking advocates consider smoke-free housing the latest major front in the long-running campaign to curb exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. The rule covering public housing forbids cigarettes, cigars, pipes and hookahs (or water pipes) \u2014 but not electronic cigarettes \u2014 from being smoked in all living units, indoor common areas, administrative offices and all outdoor areas within 25 feet of housing and office buildings.\n\nHousing agencies that already ban smoking said they enforced their policies through warnings and fines coupled with education, including counseling and smoking-cessation aids like nicotine patches.\n\n\u201cThe last thing that we want are evictions,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro, the HUD secretary, said during a call with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see this as a policy that is meant to end in a whole lot of evictions,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that public-housing authority staff can work with residents so that that can be avoided.\u201d\n\nHealth officials said that a significant amount of smoke could be transferred between apartments and that alternatives, such as improving ventilation, did not eliminate the ills of secondhand smoke, including causing or aggravating conditions like asthma and lung cancer. Children are especially vulnerable; 760,000 of them live in public housing.\n\nHousing officials said that although the federal government would not help to pay for enforcement, the public housing authorities stood to save money in averted fire losses and reduced costs for painting and cleaning smoke-damaged units.\n\nThe final rule followed a period of public comment during which some opponents took exception to the government\u2019s telling people what to do in the privacy of their own homes.\n\nIn New York, there was also concern about whether police officers would be involved in enforcing the rule; that will not be the case, Housing Authority officials said.\n\nSmoking is already prohibited in the lobbies and hallways of the city\u2019s public housing buildings.\n\nIn answer to a question, Mr. Castro said he was confident that the incoming Trump administration would not have a problem with the ban because \u201cthe public health benefit to this policy is so tremendous, and the residents\u2019 support for going smoke-free is so tremendous out there, that this rule will stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic housing will go smoke-free and remain smoke-free, and, because of that,\u201d he said, \u201cso many folks are going to live healthier lives and have a better shot at reaching their dreams because they have good health.\u201d\n", "hip pinnacle jury consumers johnson federal pay company metalonmetal implants warn patients designed found implant risks": "\nA federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said.\n\nThe jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed, and that the companies did not warn consumers of the risks.\n\nThe six plaintiffs are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials.\n\nJohnson & Johnson and DePuy are facing nearly 8,400 Pinnacle-related lawsuits, which have been consolidated in federal court in Texas. Test cases have been selected for trial, and the outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims.\n\nMark Lanier, lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the verdict was \u201ca message loud and clear\u201d that Johnson & Johnson has \u201ca really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n", "event knock made collision big study moon suggests explain formation earth explains whack side": "\nA cataclysmic collision not only created Earth\u2019s moon, but may have also knocked Earth over on its side, scientists proposed.\n\nIn a paper published last week by the journal Nature, the scientists say their numerical simulations indicate that the collision of a Mars-size object with the early Earth left our planet tilted at an angle of 60 to 80 degrees and spinning rapidly, once every two and a half hours, or almost 10 times as fast as today.\n\nBut the simulations also show how the dynamics of the moon and Earth slowed down and straightened up over the next four billion years of the solar system, leaving them where they are today.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, this paper has a model that says we can start in one place and explain all of that without invoking any other follow-on event,\u201d said Sarah T. Stewart, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Davis. \u201cAnd that\u2019s new, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did the moon come from?\u201d has been a persistent question over the eons. Among the rocky planets of the inner solar system, Earth is an anomaly. Mercury and Venus have no moons at all, and Mars has only a couple of potato-shape tiny moons (both less than 15 miles across) that may be captured asteroids.\n\nEarth\u2019s moon, by comparison, is a giant, more than 2,000 miles in diameter.\n\nIn recent years, the preferred explanation for the origin of the moon has been \u201cthe big whack\u201d: very soon after the formation of Earth and the rest of the solar system, the Mars-size interloper that astronomers have named Theia bumped into Earth. The resulting slosh of debris coalesced into a slightly larger Earth and the moon in orbit around Earth.\n\nThe hypothesis explains a lot, in particular how to create a big moon. (Others have suggested that the moon formed elsewhere and was then captured by Earth\u2019s gravity or that the two formed at the same time, in orbit around each other, but no one could calculate how these could plausibly occur.)\n\nBut there remained nagging discrepancies between the moon as it exists and the predictions of the big whack model. For one, the composition of the moon is very similar to that of Earth. Planetary scientists would have thought the moon would more closely resemble Theia.\n\nIn 2012, Dr. Stewart and Matija Cuk, then a postdoctoral researcher, proposed a variation, that Theia slammed into Earth at high speed, scrambling up the materials of the two bodies. The resulting Earth would also have been spinning fast, and they explained how the gravitational interactions with the sun would have then slowed everything.\n\n\u201cWe changed the impactor,\u201d Dr. Stewart said. \u201cWe changed the energy. We\u2019re changing momentum. We\u2019re changing the way the moon forms. We\u2019re now changing the whole dynamical sequence. Everything is different except the words, \u2018giant impact.\u2019\u201d\n\nDr. Stewart and Dr. Cuk said the revised calculations explained most everything about the moon.\n\nBut there was still a nagging discrepancy \u2014 a five-degree tilt of the moon\u2019s orbit compared with the orbits of the planets and most everything else in the solar system. It\u2019s what astronomers call the plane of the ecliptic.\n\nThe motion of moons and planets follow an orderly set of rules, Dr. Stewart said. \u201cIt makes very clean predictions, and when something goes against the orderly set of rules, it requires something special happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThe clean prediction is the moon is in the ecliptic. Period. That\u2019s where it should be.\u201d\n\nAt its birth, the moon was quite close to Earth, probably within 20,000 miles. Because of the tidal pulls between Earth and moon, the moon\u2019s orbit has been spiraling outward ever since, and as it does, Earth\u2019s pull diminishes and the pull of the sun becomes more dominant.\n\nBy now, with the moon a quarter of a million miles from Earth, the sun\u2019s gravity should have tipped the moon\u2019s orbit to lie in the same plane as the ecliptic. Last year, two astronomers proposed that planetesimals perhaps as big as the moon itself buzzing through the inner solar system tipped the moon\u2019s orbit through repeated close passes.\n\nDr. Cuk, now a scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., came up with an alternate idea: Maybe the moon\u2019s orbit is still tilted, because the Earth started off very tilted. The flexing of the Earth and the moon by the gravitational tidal forces dissipates energy, causing the moon to spiral outward. The dynamics can become complicated.\n\n\u201cThe lunar spin axis does interesting things,\u201d said Dr. Cuk, the lead author of the new Nature paper.\n\nFor example, tidal locking \u2014 where one side of the moon always faces Earth \u2014 is lost for a while before locking in again. It is possible that the far side of the moon was originally the near side.\n\nDr. Stewart said some of the transitions in orbits could have heated up the interior of the moon, and signs of that melting might be observable in rocks on the moon.\n\nAlessandro Morbidelli, one of the astronomers who proposed the planetesimals hypothesis, said nothing was proved yet, and both models relied on assumptions. \u201cCertainly it is an interesting model and it will trigger a lot of future work,\u201d he said of the new paper. \u201cI think that our model cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n", "life genetics string science thousand theory breakthrough mathematicians awards prizes scientists areas math physicists": "\nThe biggest prize payday in science came around again Sunday evening when the Breakthrough Foundation  handed out more than $25 million in its annual prizes to more than a thousand physicists, life scientists and mathematicians.\n\nThis year\u2019s winners include five molecular biologists who won $3 million each for work in genetics and cell biology, one mathematician, a trio of string theorists who split one $3 million physics prize, and another 1,015 physicists working on the LIGO gravitational wave detector split a special $3 million physics prize. In addition, there were six smaller \u201cNew Horizons\u201d prizes totaling $600,000 for 10 \u201cearly career\u201d researchers, and a pair of high school students won $400,000 apiece for making science videos.\n\nThe Breakthrough Foundation was founded by Sergey Brin of Google; Anne Wojcicki of 23andMe; Jack Ma of Alibaba and his wife, Cathy Zhang; Yuri Milner, an internet entrepreneur, and his wife, Julia Milner; and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\nIt sprang from Mr. Milner\u2019s decision in 2012 to hand out $3 million apiece to nine theoretical physicists, in the belief that physicists are equal to rock stars and deserve to be paid and celebrated like them. Over the years, as more sponsors have joined, the prizes have spread to life sciences and mathematics. The winners each year are chosen by a committee of previous winners.\n\nFor the last few years, the awards have been given out in an Oscar-style ceremony held at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, with a variety of Hollywood celebrities, who this year include Morgan Freeman, Alicia Keys and Jeremy Irons.\n\nThere were two physics prizes awarded this year.\n\nIn May, Mr. Milner, the founder of the Breakthrough initiative, announced a special $3 million prize to the LIGO (for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) experiment, which detected gravitational waves from colliding black holes last year. A third of the money will be split among the three leaders of the experiment, Ronald W.P. Drever, Kip S. Thorne and Rainer Weiss. The remainder of the award money will be split among the other 1,012 scientists on the team.\n\nIn a return to the way it originally was, the regular Breakthrough prize this year is going to a trio of theorists who have made serious advances in string theory, the alleged but still unproven theory of everything, and what it might mean for black holes and the universe. They are Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa from Harvard, and Joseph Polchinski of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nAccording to string theory, all the forces and particles of nature are composed of tiny little wriggling strings. In 1995, Dr. Polchinski showed that the theory also contains objects of two dimensions or more, called \u201cbranes,\u201d short for membranes. This led to a whole new branch of cosmology, in which branes could be island universes floating in an extra-dimensional space like leaves in a fish tank, colliding and otherwise interacting with each other through a higher dimension.\n\nIn a celebrated calculation in 1996, Dr. Strominger and Dr. Vafa used string theory to compute the information content, or entropy, of a black hole. Their result verified a prediction made by Stephen Hawking using more approximate methods that black holes would leak radiation and eventually explode.\n\nIn a career spanning four decades, Jean Bourgain, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., has published, on average, 10 papers a year, tackling some of the hardest problems in a range of mathematical fields.\n\nSome recent work includes a \u201cdecoupling theorem\u201d \u2014 a sort of very abstract generalization of Pythagorean\u2019s theorem applied to oscillating waves like light or radio waves. While Pythagoras merely showed how the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle are related to the longer hypotenuse, the decoupling theorem proven by Dr. Bourgain and Ciprian Demeter of Indiana University shows similar relationships in the superposition of waves.\n\nStephen J. Elledge, 60, is a professor of genetics and medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. He received the breakthrough prize for research explaining how \u201ccells sense and respond to damage in their DNA and providing insights into the development and treatment of cancer.\u201d\n\nDr. Elledge has described DNA as being constantly under attack but having the ability \u2014 he calls it a sort of chemical intelligence \u2014 to monitor its own integrity and activate various defense mechanisms.\n\nHis research interests range far and wide. In 2015, he and his team reported that they had developed a test that, using less than a drop of blood, could reveal nearly every virus a person had ever been exposed to. Other scientists saw vast potential in the test, suggesting it could be used to track patterns of disease across populations and to learn more about how viruses, and the body\u2019s immune response to them, contribute to chronic diseases and cancer.\n\nLast year, Dr. Elledge won another major prize: the Lasker Award, which is often described as the American Nobel.\n\nHarry F. Noller helped unravel the structure of ribosomes and identify the importance of RNA to their mechanics. Ribosomes are like factories that assemble proteins within a cell. They look like a tangled mess of rubber bands and coiled wires. But by decoding their twists and folds, scientists can better understand how the genetic code gets translated.\n\nDr. Noller is a biochemist and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He and his colleagues used X-ray crystallography to obtain the first image of the ribosome\u2019s molecular structure. His work also helped show that ribosomes are ribozymes, a type of RNA molecule that can facilitate chemical reactions. In this case, the ribozymes stitch amino acids together to build proteins.\n\nRoeland Nusse, professor of developmental biology at Stanford University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, helped discover the first Wnt gene in 1982. The gene is part of the larger Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in the development of embryos, stem cells, bone growth and the progression of cancer. It is also critical for cell-to-cell communication in adults and developing embryos.\n\nThe Wnt signaling pathway is found in every branch of the animal kingdom. It is involved in things as diverse as setting off breast cancer in mice and helping orchestrate the body plan of fruit flies. It has become an important part in many aspects of biology because the molecular cascade it sets off affects the growth of the entire ecosystem of the body.\n\nDr. Huda Zoghbi, a professor of neurology at Baylor College of Medicine, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and director of the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital, discovered that a mutation to a gene known as SCA1 causes Spinocerebellar ataxia, a neurodegenerative disorder. It can rob people of their control over their hands, legs and speech. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States currently suffer from the disease. There is no known cure and it ultimately is fatal.\n\nBut insight into its inner workings may provide a way to combat its progression. Dr. Zoghbi\u2019s findings have helped provide the groundwork to fighting the disease.\n\nDr. Zoghbi also helped uncover the culprit behind another neurodegenerative disease, Rett syndrome. This crippling condition mostly affects young girls and is often fatal. There are fewer than 1,000 cases a year in the United States. Her team searched for the cause behind the malady for 16 years, eventually identifying it as a mutation in the gene MECP2. By identifying the gene, she also found that it plays a part in other neurological disorders, providing a starting point to fighting the diseases.\n\nYoshinori Ohsumi, a cell biologist and honorary professor from the Institute of Innovative Research at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, helped pioneer our understanding of how cells recycle themselves \u2014 known as autophagy \u2014 through his research with yeast in the 1990s.\n\nOrganelles, proteins and other molecules inside the cell are constantly becoming damaged or worn out, especially as the cell divides. If too much rubbish builds up, it can become toxic and kill the cell. Autophagy is also a tool that the cell uses to refuel itself if it is starving.\n\nDuring autophagy, the cell produces internal garbage bags called autophagosomes that capture waste. The autophagosomes are sealed by a double membrane that keeps in the junk. They then fuse with organelles called lysosomes, which carry enzymes that help dissolve whatever is inside.\n\nResearchers think that failures in autophagy could contribute to Type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They also think it could help us better understand the process of aging.\n\nThis year, Dr. Ohsumi won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for illuminating the importance of cell cannibalism.\n\nIn addition to the big $3 million prizes, there were six $100,000 New Horizons prizes \u2013 half in physics and half in mathematics. The young physics winners are: Asimina Arvanitaki of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada; Peter Graham of Stanford and Surjeet Rajendran of the University of California, Berkeley, who split one prize; Simone Giombi of Princeton and Xi Yin of Harvard split another prize; and Frans Pretorius of Princeton.\n\nIn mathematics, the New Horizons winners were Mohammed Abouzaid of Columbia University; Hugo Duminil-Copin of the University of Geneva; and Benjamin Elias of the University of Oregon and Geordie Williamson of Kyoto University.\n", "woman shoes win tuesday singercumdesigner award rihanna celebrating york awards shoe year news achievement footwear": "\nIn today\u2019s politically charged climate, even shoes can be contentious.\n\nAt the 30th annual Footwear News Achievement Awards, held on Tuesday evening at the IAC building in Manhattan, Ronnie Fieg of the label Kith offered a \u201cno comment\u201d when asked about his collaboration with New Balance, a brand that found itself in cross hairs this month after one of its senior representatives voiced support for President-elect Donald J. Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to speak on that,\u201d said Mr. Fieg, who had won Retailer of the Year. \u201cI don\u2019t get political.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one asked about something besides the accouterments on his feet.\n\nAnsel Elgort, the actor and son of the photographer Arthur Elgort, who was there to present the Designer of the Year award to Paul Andrew, reflected on the protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline.\n\n\u201cIt shows how disappointing our country can be in regards to many things,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding some things, however \u2014 like Rihanna \u2014 disappointment is not a factor.\n\nThe singer was on hand to receive the Shoe of the Year award for her collaborative project with Puma, the Creeper, making her the first woman to receive such recognition.\n\nRihanna wore a long-sleeved black top and baseball cap from Vetements with the word \u201cSecurite\u201d printed across both, a Vetements x Juicy Couture maxi dress beneath, and the shoe of the hour: a platform sneaker with a black suede top. She swept in just as the ceremony was about to begin, causing a commotion and drawing the attention of guests like Mark King, president of Adidas, and Dick Johnson, chief executive of Foot Locker; the designers Alexandre Birman and John Varvatos; and other celebrities (Dascha Polanco of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and the model Christie Brinkley).\n\nAs Rihanna moved toward her table, the speakers pumped \u201cThis Is What You Came For,\u201d her song with Calvin Harris, and the crowd turned into a Rihanna-worshipping, bubbly-sipping stampede.\n\nOn her way, she was stopped by Cuba Gooding Jr., who recently played O. J. Simpson in \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story,\u201d and who wanted to pay his respects.\n\nGiven that the shoe of the year was a sneaker, Mr. Gooding was asked whether he\u2019s a sneaker man. \u201cNo, but I used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to be a breakdancer back in the \u201980s, and you weren\u2019t worth your weight unless you wore Converse high-tops.\u201d Now, however, he\u2019s all about the work boot. \u201cI live in my Blundstones,\u201d he said. \u201cI have eight pairs. They\u2019re all black.\u201d\n\nThough Rihanna refused interviews, Adam Petrick, Puma\u2019s director of brand and marketing, offered glowing reviews of the singer-cum-designer, noting that the partnership had cast the brand in a new light.\n\n\u201cA lot of streetwear retailers opened their minds to \u2018Puma isn\u2019t just a classic, casual comfort shoe, but maybe Puma has an interesting design aesthetic,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt helped us with getting a second look from retailers who hadn\u2019t been considering us.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Rihanna nodded to that connection, thanking \u201call the kids in the street that inspired me just by doing things their own way.\u201d\n\nOther winners of the evening included the actress and singer Zendaya, 20, for the release of her Daya collection, and Iris Apfel, 95, for, well, being Iris Apfel.\n\nMs. Apfel, the Icon Award winner, brought a dash of levity to the night of networking, long-winded speeches and insistently earnest congratulations.\n\nStepping up to the stage with the help of Michael Atmore, the editorial director of Footwear News, and another man, she noted, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be old and have two pieces of beefcake escort you.\u201d Whomever they voted for.\n", "provide house safe laying patients decisions heard clinic place rooms clean bare nondescript wrenching tug": "\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d my patient\u2019s wife told me, her face a tapestry of conflicting emotions. My patient was watching her, too, trying to figure out if he should echo her happiness, or her grief.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to offer congratulations, but I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d I said, trying to feel her out. She had been holding her breath for what seemed like minutes, and finally exhaled before answering.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go through with the pregnancy.\u201d\n\nMy patient flinched a bit, but didn\u2019t say anything. Both he and his wife were in their 30s, and he had been given a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia a year earlier.\n\nC.M.L. is one of our great success stories in cancer therapies. In 2001 the drug imatinib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the disease, and was so effective that almost immediately the number of C.M.L. patients who required bone marrow transplantation plummeted. Over 90 percent of patients achieve some sort of remission, which lasts for years in the majority. Since then, four other pills have been approved by the F.D.A. for C.M.L., each at least as effective, if not more so, than the original.\n\nMy patient wasn\u2019t so lucky. His blood counts dropped to dangerously low levels with each medication we tried, none of which brought him close to a remission, and it appeared likely that he would need a bone-marrow transplant in the next few months, a procedure that carried with it risks of serious health problems, and even death.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going through your mind?\u201d I asked her.\n\nThis time her husband responded. \u201cI was taking the chemotherapy when she got pregnant. We\u2019re worried about birth defects.\u201d\n\nThis was terrain I had traversed before. Data about pregnant women exposed to chemotherapy for treatment of cancer, summarized in a National Toxicology Program report, show an apparent rate of major congenital malformations of 14 percent following first trimester exposure, and 3 percent thereafter. The qualifier apparent is used because these are only estimates, as information about birth defects is not rigorously reported. For men on chemotherapy at the time of conception, the data are even sparser.\n\nAs a result, we adjust recommendations about whether or not to continue with a pregnancy based on the timing of chemotherapy relative to the pregnancy, whether it is the man or woman who is exposed, and on the known likelihood that the chemotherapy will cause birth defects or fetal mortality. For patients who are pregnant in their first trimester with a new diagnosis of acute leukemia \u2014 a cancer requiring high-dose chemotherapy that is almost certain to induce death of the fetus \u2014 I have recommended termination, as a blighted pregnancy would endanger the life of the immunocompromised mother.\n\nIn this case, though, I thought the risk of birth defects were low, and explained this to my patient and his wife.\n\nHe smiled and looked over to his wife, as if expecting her to join in his relief. But she still looked torn, staring straight ahead, somewhere into the space between him and me.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s going to have a transplant. What happens if I have this baby and he\u2019s not here to be its father?\u201d she asked, now looking directly at me. Tears had started to wind down her cheeks.\n\nI reached for a box of tissues to hand to her, half expecting her husband to say something encouraging about his prospects, to alleviate her fears. But he sat quietly, rubbing her back, staring into that same space she had occupied a few moments earlier. Perhaps he was struck silent by her honesty; or perhaps, by the reality of his condition.\n\n\u201cHopefully the transplant will go smoothly, he\u2019ll be cured of his leukemia, and we\u2019ll all look back at this conversation and wonder why we even had it,\u201d I told her. His focus shifted back to us.\n\n\u201cBut you both know,\u201d I continued, \u201cthere are no guarantees. On the one hand, it will be hard to care for a baby and for him as he goes through the transplant. It may be even harder if he doesn\u2019t survive.\u201d They nodded in agreement.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, if the worst happens, and he dies, you\u2019ll still have a part of him that will live on.\u201d\n\nThey sat in silence, my patient and his wife, each thinking about their possible futures: one with him present as a father, and one without.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t my decision to make, or one in which I could provide any more informed advice. I sensed they wanted time to be alone, and said goodbye as I got up to leave.\n\nMy clinic rooms, clean and nondescript as they are, sometimes provide a safe house for laying bare the difficult thoughts, the wrenching decisions, that tug on my patients. I couldn\u2019t guide this couple on what to do about the pregnancy, but they weren\u2019t really asking me to.\n\nThey just wanted to be heard. By me, but more important, by each other.\n", "glue adhesive dedicated include rubbish humanitys company startup japanese satellite entrepreneur job spaces cleaning hardesttoreach plans small trash collector called astroscale": "\nTOKYO \u2014 Sitting in a drab industrial neighborhood surrounded by warehouses and factories, Astroscale\u2019s Tokyo office seems appropriately located for a company seeking to enter the waste management business.\n\nOnly inside do visitors see signs that its founder, Mitsunobu Okada, aspires to be more than an ordinary garbageman. Schoolroom pictures of the planets decorate the door to the meeting room. Satellite mock-ups occupy a corner. Mr. Okada greets guests in a dark blue T-shirt emblazoned with his company\u2019s slogan: Space Sweepers.\n\nMr. Okada is an entrepreneur with a vision of creating the first trash collection company dedicated to cleaning up some of humanity\u2019s hardest-to-reach rubbish: the spent rocket stages, inert satellites and other debris that have been collecting above Earth since Sputnik ushered in the space age. He launched Astroscale three years ago in the belief that national space agencies were dragging their feet in facing the problem, which could be tackled more quickly by a small private company motivated by profit.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, waste management isn\u2019t sexy enough for a space agency to convince taxpayers to allocate money,\u201d said Mr. Okada, 43, who put Astroscale\u2019s headquarters in start-up-friendly Singapore but is building its spacecraft in his native Japan, where he found more engineers. \u201cMy breakthrough is figuring out how to make this into a business.\u201d\n\nOver the last half-century, low Earth orbit has become so littered with debris that space agencies and scientists warn of the increasing danger of collisions for satellites and manned spacecraft. The United States Air Force now keeps track of about 23,000 pieces of space junk that are big enough \u2014 about four inches or larger \u2014 to be detected from the ground.\n\nScientists say there could be tens of millions of smaller particles, such as bolts or chunks of frozen engine coolant, that cannot be discerned from Earth. Even the tiniest pieces move through orbit at speeds fast enough to turn them into potentially deadly projectiles. In 1983, the space shuttle Challenger returned to Earth with a pea-size pit in its windshield from a paint-chip strike.\n\nAnd plans are being made to make low orbit even busier, and more essential for communications on Earth. Companies like SpaceX and OneWeb are aiming to create vast new networks of hundreds or even thousands of satellites to provide global internet connectivity and cellphone coverage. The growth of traffic increases the risk of collisions that could disrupt communications, as in 2009 when a dormant Russian military satellite slammed into a private American communications satellite, causing brief disruptions for satellite-phone users.\n\nWorse, each strike like that creates a cloud of shrapnel, potentially setting off a chain reaction of collisions that could render low orbit unusable.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t start removing these things, the debris environment will become unstable,\u201d said William Ailor, a fellow at the Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research and development center in California. \u201cWe will continue to have a growing debris population that could affect the ability to operate satellites.\u201d\n\nEnter Mr. Okada, a former government official and internet entrepreneur, who said a midlife crisis four years ago prompted him to return to his childhood passion of space. As a teenager in 1988, he flew to Alabama to join the United States Space Camp at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, and later chose to attend business school at Purdue University, the alma mater of his hero, Neil Armstrong.\n\nLater, Mr. Okada realized that he could use his experience in the start-up world \u2014 he had founded a software company in 2009 \u2014 to get a jump on other space debris projects.\n\n\u201cThe projects all smelled like government, not crisp or quick,\u201d he said of conferences he attended to learn about other efforts. \u201cI came from the start-up world where we think in days or weeks, not years.\u201d\n\nHe said he has created a two-step plan for making money from debris removal. First, Astroscale plans to launch a 50-pound satellite called IDEA OSG 1 next year aboard a Russian rocket. The craft will carry panels that can measure the number of strikes from debris of even less than a millimeter. Astroscale will use this data to compile the first detailed maps of debris density at various altitudes and locations, which can then be sold to satellite operators and space agencies, Mr. Okada said.\n\n\u201cWe need to get revenue at an early stage, even before doing actual debris removal, to prove that we are commercial, as a business,\u201d said Mr. Okada, who added that he had already raised $43 million from investors.\n\nThe more ambitious step will come in 2018, when Mr. Okada says Astroscale will launch a craft called the ELSA 1. Larger than its predecessor, the ELSA 1 will be loaded with sensors and maneuvering thrusters that will allow it to track and intercept a piece of debris.\n\nThe company settled on a lightweight and simple approach to grabbing space debris: glue. Astroscale has worked with a Japanese chemical company to create an adhesive that would cover a flat surface about the size of a dinner plate on the ELSA 1. The craft would bump into a piece of space junk, which would stick to the craft and be dragged out of orbit. Both the ELSA 1 and the debris would burn up on re-entry.\n\nThe concept of deorbiting space junk is not novel. As the debris problem has grown in urgency in recent years, space agencies and companies have released dozens of concepts for cleaning up low Earth orbit.\n\nThe Air Force has proposed a \u201claser broom\u201d that would use ground-based lasers to vaporize a spot on an object\u2019s surface, creating a puff that would act like an engine to push it down toward the atmosphere.\n\nOther proposals call for using robotic arms, nets, tethers and even harpoons to spear debris. The challenge, experts say, is to build an unmanned spacecraft that can be used to track, approach and grab a dark object tumbling through space at 17,000 miles per hour.\n\n\u201cImagine trying to grab a spinning skater on an ice rink,\u201d said Raymond J. Sedwick, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland, \u201cexcept, instead of a person, it\u2019s an S.U.V. And instead of you being there in person, you\u2019re remotely flying a drone, the lighting is bad, you have limited sensory data, there is no obvious place to grab onto, and you might be operating under a time delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat said, we need to do something\u201d about space debris, Dr. Sedwick said.\n\nEven if a technology works, such efforts face another hurdle: the cost.\n\nMr. Okada said the key to bringing down a price tag of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars is to reduce the weight. He said that the Elsa 1\u2019s adhesive would weigh just a few ounces, far less than, say, a 100-pound robotic arm, and that his company\u2019s engineers had found ways to bring the spacecraft\u2019s weight down to 200 pounds, making it much lighter than other proposed craft.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., aerospace engineers are more interested in working on missions to Mars, not waste management,\u201d Mr. Okada said. \u201cJapan doesn\u2019t have so many interesting space missions, so engineers were excited by my idea.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Astroscale would start by contracting with companies that will operate big satellite networks to remove their own malfunctioning satellites. He said that if a company has a thousand satellites, several are bound to fail. Astroscale will remove these, allowing the company to fill the gap in its network by replacing the failed unit with a functioning satellite.\n\n\u201cOur first targets won\u2019t be random debris, but our clients\u2019 own satellites,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can build up to removing debris as we perfect our technology.\u201d\n\nHe said this approach would also get around a hurdle in international law to the removal of space debris \u2014 the required permission of the owner. Under a 1967 treaty, man-made objects in space belong to the countries that launched them, and cannot be touched without approval.\n\nMr. Okada said finding ways around these various barriers was more than a business proposition; it would also be the fulfillment of a childhood dream.\n\n\u201cI see a business opportunity in solving a problem that nobody knows how to solve,\u201d Mr. Okada said. \u201cBut my enthusiasm is because I am going back to my teenage passion: space.\u201d\n", "life death young forever rest son lives child carry man loving": "\nI can feel their unasked questions. People wonder how I can still stand, still walk, still laugh. But they don\u2019t ask. You can\u2019t ask that of a mother who has lost her child. My son, Daniel, died three years ago at the age of 22. When people ask me, \u201cHow\u2026 are you?,\u201d that pause, that inflection, tells me that\u2019s really what they want to know.\n\nI am tempted to tell them that it is I who am lost, not he. I am lost in my search for him, knowing he is nowhere on this earth. And still, it would not surprise me if he were to appear by my side wearing only his jersey boxers eating a snack at the kitchen counter. At times I can almost smell his warm cheesy breath and his still-boyish sweat. But when I look over my shoulder, he is not there.\n\nMy mind invents stories. Daniel is not dead; he is lamenting the performance of his fantasy football team with high school buddies while they wait on line for ice cream at Magic Fountain. He is in his dorm room at Stanford, talking deep into the night with his friends. Daniel is lingering with new friends on the rooftop of his investment firm in Boston where he just started working.\n\n\u201cWhere are you, Daniel?\u201d I shout the question to the sky when I am strong enough to bear the silence that follows. \u201cWhy did you die?\u201d Even that has no real answer. His doctors think Daniel died of new onset refractory status epilepticus, or Norse, a rare seizure disorder in which healthy people with no history of epilepsy suddenly begin to seize uncontrollably. The majority of patients die or survive with significant brain damage. There is no identified cause or established treatment for Norse. This cloud of uncertainty does not obscure what I know: My child is dead.\n\nThe instinct to protect one\u2019s offspring runs through mothers of virtually all species. I violated the basic canon of motherhood. I failed to protect my child. That my child is dead while I still live defies the natural order.\n\nI love my husband and our two surviving children, but I couldn\u2019t simply transfer my love for Daniel to them. It was for him alone. And so, for the longest time after his death, my love for Daniel bruised me.\n\nSo unbearable was my occluded heart that I called out to him in desperation one day: \u201cWhat will I do with my love for you, Daniel?\u201d\n\nMy eyes were closed in grief when suddenly I seemed to see him before me, his arms bent and lifted upward in supplication. In my mind\u2019s eye, his face was suffused with love and tinged with exasperation, a common look for Daniel.\n\n\u201cJust love me, Mom,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut where are you?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d he answers with frustration. And then he is gone.\n\nI had not heard his voice since the day before he suddenly fell ill. I spoke to him while he lay unseeing and unmoving in the hospital bed. I told him I loved him. I begged him to speak to me. I begged him to come back to me. He never answered or moved to squeeze my hand. The only flicker from him over his 79 days of hospitalization was a single tear. One day a tear slid from his left eye down his cheek and disappeared beneath his chin.\n\nAnd now, months after he had died, I felt him before me.\n\n\u201cJust love me, Mom. I\u2019m here!\u201d\n\nHis words unleashed a torrent. I fell forward, my tears streaming. I felt breathless with release. I could continue to love him. I would love him in a new way.\n\nIt was harder to do than I expected. I would see him everywhere, in every full moon, in each brilliant day. My spirits would soar. But there were days when a weight in my heart made each breath shallow and every step an effort.\n\nOn the worst days I sit before my laptop and pour out my feelings to the only person who can take in my sorrow and remain unbowed. The keyboard is damp when the final refrain leaves my fingertips: I love you, Daniel, I love you. I miss you. I miss you. And then I press \u201csend.\u201d\n\nDaniel\u2019s friends continue to visit us. It is a pilgrimage of sorts. My heart tightens when I see them. Their presence illuminates our immeasurable loss.\n\nHis friends reveal to me how much Daniel meant to them. Now there will be a missing groomsman at the wedding and empty air in the place of a steadfast friend. At the end of one visit, a young man asks, \u201cRecognize this sweater?\u201d I don\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s Daniel\u2019s,\u201d he explains. I suddenly recognize Daniel\u2019s old cotton sweater stretched to fit his friend. The young man folds forward to touch the sleeves of the sweater, hugging himself. He is tall and blond and athletic. He and Daniel were opposites in looks and temperament, best friends since nursery school. He had just returned from Moscow where he was working. \u201cI wear this when I travel,\u201d he says, touching the arm of the sweater again. \u201cIt\u2019s so soft.\u201d\n\nI encourage Daniel\u2019s friends to tell me about their work and their plans for the future. At first they are self-conscious, and their voices are tender. They don\u2019t want to hurt me with their future plans when there is no future for Daniel. But as they speak of the things they will do and the places they will go, their excitement breaks free. I smile into the glow of their unlined, earnest faces and I feel my son. I think they feel him too. For a moment we are all reunited.\n\nI will carry this child for the rest of my life. He lives within me, forever a young man of 22. Others will carry him as they move forward in their lives. He will be with them when they look out to the world with compassion, when they act with determination and kindness, when they are brave enough to contemplate all the things in life that remain unknown.\n\nI still search for him, but without desperation. I look for him in others. My search is lifted by his words: \u201cJust love me. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n", "webb hubble ate telescope space track james schedule years surpass launch astronomy": "\nGREENBELT, Md. \u2014 The next great space telescope spread its golden wings this month.\n\nLike the petals of a 20-foot sunflower seeking the light, the 18 hexagonal mirrors that make up the heart of NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope were faced toward a glassed-in balcony overlooking a cavernous clean room at the Goddard Space Flight Center here.\n\nInside the room, reporters and a gaggle of space agency officials, including the ebullient administrator Charles Bolden, were getting their pictures taken in front of the giant mirror.\n\nNow, after 20 years with a budget of $8.7 billion, the Webb telescope is on track and on budget to be launched in October 2018 and sent a million miles from Earth, NASA says.\n\nThe telescope, named after NASA Administrator James Webb, who led the space agency in the 1960s, is the long-awaited successor of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nSeven times larger than the Hubble in light-gathering ability, the Webb was designed to see farther out in space and deeper into the past of the universe. It may solve mysteries about how and when the first stars and galaxies emerged some 13 billion years ago in the smoky aftermath of the Big Bang.\n\nEquipped with the sort of infrared goggles that give troops and police officers night vision, the Webb would peer into the dust clouds and gas storms of the Milky Way in which stars and planets are presently being birthed. It would be able to study planets around other stars.\n\nThat has been NASA\u2019s dream since 1996 when the idea for the telescope was conceived with a projected price tag then of $500 million But as recently as six years ago, the James Webb Space Telescope was, in the words of Nature magazine, \u201cthe telescope that ate astronomy,\u201d mismanaged, over budget and behind schedule so that it had crushed everything else out of NASA\u2019s science budget.\n\nA House subcommittee once voted to cancel it. Instead, the program was rebooted with a strict spending cap.\n\nThe scientific capabilities of the telescope emerged unscathed from that period, astronomers on the project say. The major change, said Jonathan P. Gardner, the deputy senior project scientist, was to simplify the testing of the telescope.\n\nMost of the pain was dealt to other NASA projects like a proposed space telescope to study dark energy, which the National Academy of Sciences had hoped to put on a fast track to be launched this decade. It\u2019s now delayed until 2025 or so.\n\nTypically for NASA, the Webb telescope was a technologically ambitious project, requiring 10 new technologies to make it work. Bill Ochs, a veteran Goddard engineer who became project manager in 2010 during what he calls the \u201creplan,\u201d said the key to its success so far, was having enough money in the budget to provide a cushion for nasty surprises.\n\nThe telescope smiling up at us like a giant Tiffany shaving mirror is 6.5 meters in diameter, or just over 21 feet, compared with 2.4 meters for the Hubble. The aim is to explore a realm of cosmic history about 150 million to one billion years after time began \u2014 known as the reionization epoch, when bright and violent new stars and the searing radiation from quasars were burning away a gloomy fog of hydrogen gas that prevailed at the end of the Big Bang.\n\nIn fact, astronomers don\u2019t know how the spectacle that greets our eyes every night when the sun goes down or the lights go out wrenched itself into luminous existence. They theorize that an initial generation of stars made purely of hydrogen and helium \u2014 the elements created during the Big Bang \u2014 burned ferociously and exploded apocalyptically, jump-starting the seeding of the cosmos with progressively more diverse materials. But nobody has ever seen any so-called Population 3 stars, as those first stars are known. They don\u2019t exist in the modern universe. Astronomers have to hunt them in the dim past.\n\nThat ambition requires the Webb to be tuned to a different kind of light than our eyes or the Hubble can see. Because the expansion of the cosmos is rushing those earliest stars and galaxies away from us so fast, their light is \u201cred-shifted\u201d to longer wavelengths the way the siren from an ambulance shifts to a lower register as it passes by.\n\nSo blue light from an infant galaxy bursting with bright spanking new stars way back then has been stretched to invisible infrared wavelengths, or heat radiation, by the time it reaches us 13 billion years later.\n\nAs a result, the Webb telescope will produce cosmic postcards in colors no eye has ever seen. It also turns out that infrared emanations are the best way to study exoplanets, the worlds beyond our own solar system that have been discovered in the thousands since the Webb telescope was first conceived.\n\nIn order to see those infrared colors, however, the telescope has to be very cold \u2014 less than 45 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero \u2014 so that its own heat does not swamp the heat from outer space. Once in space, the telescope will unfold a giant umbrella the size of a tennis court to keep the sun off it. The telescope, marooned in permanent shade a million miles beyond the moon, will experience an infinite cold soak.\n\nThe sunshield consists of five thin, kite-shaped layers of a material called Kapton. Way too big to fit into a rocket, the shield, as well as the telescope mirror, will have be launched folded up. It will then be unfolded in space in a series of some 180 maneuvers that look in computer animations like a cross between a parachute opening and a swimming pool cover going into place.\n\nOr at least that is the $8 billion plan.\n\nEngineers have done it on the ground, and it worked. The same people who refolded the shield after each test will fold it again, in a process Mr. Ochs compares to packing up your parachute before a jump. The test will come in space, where no one will be able to help if things go wrong.\n\nThat whole process will amount to what Mr. Ochs called \u201csix months of high anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the most part, it all has to work,\u201d Mr. Ochs said.\n\nThe last time NASA did something this big astronomically, in 1990, things didn\u2019t quite work. Once in orbit, the Hubble couldn\u2019t be focused; it had a misshapen mirror that had never been properly tested. Astronauts eventually fitted it with corrective lenses, and it went on to become the crown jewel of astronomy.\n\nMaking sure that doesn\u2019t happen this time is the agenda for the next two years. \u201cOur telescope is finished,\u201d John C. Mather, the senior project scientist, said. \u201cNow we are about to prove it works.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, the mirror and the box of scientific instruments on its back will be put on a rig and shaken to simulate the vibrations of a launch, and then sealed in an acoustic chamber and bombarded with the noise of a launch.\n\nIf the parts survive unscathed, the telescope assembly will be shipped to a giant vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. There it will be chilled to the deep-space temperatures at which it will have to work, and engineers will actually focus the telescope, twiddling the controls for seven actuators on each of the 18 mirror segments. No Hubble surprises here.\n\nThen the telescope will go to Los Angeles to be mounted on its gigantic sunshield. That whole contraption, now too big for even the giant C-5A military transport plane, will travel by ship through the Panama Canal to French Guiana.\n\nIt will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket supplied by the European Space Agency as part of Europe\u2019s contribution to the observatory, and go into orbit around the sun at a point called L2 about a million miles from Earth. Canada, NASA\u2019s other partner, supplied some of the instruments.\n\nThen come the six months of anxiety. Sometime in the spring of 2019, if all goes well, the telescope will record its first real image \u2014 of what, the assembled astronomers were not ready to guess. In a bonus undreamed of when the Webb telescope was first conceived, it looks as if the Hubble will still be going strong when the Webb is launched. They will share the sky and the potential for joint observing projects. A million miles apart, they can view objects in the solar system from different angles, providing a kind of stereoscopic perspective.\n\nBesides the expected baby galaxies and the exoplanets, there are, as astronomers like to remind us, always new surprises (like colliding black holes when the LIGO observatory was turned on last year) when humanity devises a new way to look at the sky.\n\nAsked what the telescope\u2019s greatest discovery would be, Dr. Mather said, \u201cIf I knew, I would tell you.\u201d\n\nNor would the project members talk about contingency plans to rescue the telescope if anything goes wrong a million miles from Earth. There are no plans to fix it or bring it back. They know how to attach a probe or robot to the telescope, Dr. Mather said, but \u201cwe are planning to not need it, thank you.\u201d\n", "hours school cheerleaders stirring iraan quarterfinal bus carrying football sponsors dead leaving high state won victory struck unthinkable texas highway": "\nIRAAN, Tex. \u2014 This is not the story we intended to report, about a fatal bus crash and injured cheerleaders and ecstatic celebration whipsawed into gut-punching tragedy.\n\nI traveled to West Texas last week with the photographer Ilana Panich-Linsman for more salutary reasons. We wanted to chronicle a high school football team so dominant that it had not lost a regular-season game in four seasons, and yet in a place so tiny and remote that homecoming was held only every other year.\n\nThere was to be a quirky angle, too, a somewhat irritated but mostly amused reaction here to viral fake-news videos posted in January on a website called Stranger Than Fiction News. The videos claimed that Iraan (pronounced Ira Ann) was a ghost town, not the oil town it is. That no one lived there. That the football team was a fake bused in from elsewhere. That the 1,200 residents actually lived underground in a secret city.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t have a dome on our stadium,\u201d Jim Baum, 49, the principal at Iraan High School, joked on Friday morning. \u201cYou don\u2019t need one when you\u2019re underground.\u201d\n\nAs the undefeated Iraan Braves prepared for a three-hour trip to play in the state quarterfinals, I spoke with Christina Garlock, 48. She ran the high school\u2019s computer lab and sponsored the varsity cheerleaders. She has a daughter who is a cheerleader and two sons who play on the team. She spoke of the 11 seniors who had played together since elementary school and had lost only three or four games their entire lives.\n\n\u201cThese kids knew 20-something plays in third grade,\u201d Ms. Garlock said.\n\nWhen the team buses headed out of town Friday, escorted by a fire truck, residents gathered and waved, many soon to follow on the trip to Colorado City, Tex., where the game would be played at a neutral site.\n\nMs. Panich-Linsman photographed one of the well-wishers, who wore an Indian headdress. She was Liz Pope, 52, Ms. Garlock\u2019s sister, who worked in the computer lab at the elementary school. She also served as the sponsor of the junior high cheerleaders and was an effervescent president of the high school booster club.\n\nHours later, Iraan won the game, reaching the state semifinals for the first time in 20 years.\n\nAnd Ms. Pope was dead.\n\nThere had been a horrific accident on a cold, rainy night. Her sister was seriously injured, along with several cheerleaders. A small town was left stunned and inconsolable.\n\n\u201cYou thought you were going to win the race but instead you drove off a cliff,\u201d said Kevin Allen, 59, the superintendent of the local school district.\n\nIt was such a jarring and shocking whiplash of a town\u2019s emotions, revelry to disaster less than two hours after the game had ended. Everything had been so light and expectant on Friday morning. The entire student body, from kindergarten through 12th grade, gathered in the school auditorium for a rousing send-off for the football team. Heavy metal music played, cowbells rang and video highlights showed Iraan\u2019s victory in the previous playoff round.\n\nThe opponent on Friday was the Munday Moguls. On the video, Kix Bales, 6, the son of a coach, said he did not know what a mogul was, \u201cbut I know I don\u2019t want to be one tonight.\u201d\n\nKurt Hanna, 41, Iraan High\u2019s technology director, stood at the back of the auditorium. His father, Larry, had coached the team to its lone state championship, in 1996. Kurt had been an all-American pole-vaulter at Baylor University. He talked about the pride and tradition and belonging that football fostered in the town from a young age.\n\nHis own son, Kayin, 8, was a ball boy. Each week, Kayin asked his father, \u201cYou think we\u2019ll make it for state?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lives football 24/7,\u201d Mr. Hanna said. \u201cIt\u2019s an expectation. These kids don\u2019t know anything different.\u201d\n\nI grew up along Highway 190 in Louisiana, the same road that runs 650 miles to the west through Iraan. The town, near one of the country\u2019s largest oil fields, was said to be holding its own against the industry downturn.\n\nI knew many small towns with big aspirations for football. Perhaps none bigger than this one. Storefronts were painted in team symbols. Wooden cutouts at Mesquite Wood Bar-B-Q allowed customers to pose for photographs as a player or a cheerleader. Black and red streamers fluttered at the public library and Juanita\u2019s Hair Design. Paper cups placed in the chain-link fence at the youth center spelled \u201cFeel Our Power\u201d and \u201cDefense Is Awesome.\u201d\n\nAt Isabella\u2019s Kitchen, the walls displayed news clippings from Iraan High\u2019s 1996 state championship team and photographs of current players from their days in peewee football. Jerseys also adorned the walls, and Christmas ornaments shaped like footballs hung from a wheel on the ceiling. On a mesa behind the stadium, a giant \u201cI\u201d shone in red lights.\n\nOf the 125 students at Iraan High, 44 played football.\n\n\u201cSome people claim football is a religion,\u201d said Brad Willock, 51, whose son, Albert, plays on the team. \u201cI guess we\u2019re more fanatical in West Texas. When you live in a small town, you want to get together and show that you\u2019re succeeding and not living in a cave in an underground government facility.\u201d\n\nThe team had left at noon and the temperature had dropped through the day, dipping to the low 40s in Colorado City by late afternoon. A light, persistent rain fell. Iraan had followed its familiar rituals and superstitions. The wives of the coaches stopped to eat corn dogs at a Sonic Drive-In. Each player had his left ankle taped first. \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d by Phil Collins played in the locker room.\n\nAnticipating rain, Iraan had practiced all week by soaking balls in a bucket of water, leaving them slippery and heavy.\n\n\u201cIt felt like I was snapping a medicine ball between my legs,\u201d said Ivan Castilla, 16, the center.\n\nAt game time, though, the meticulous preparation went awry.\n\nIraan fumbled on its first possession. After three and a half minutes, it trailed Munday by 12-0. But the Braves, an unhurried team, did not panic, scoring six consecutive touchdowns as bubbles wafted from the stands in celebration and air horns bellowed in a corner of the stadium.\n\nAfter the 40-12 victory, the Iraan players and cheerleaders raised their helmets and arms while the band played the alma mater. Coach Mark Kirchhoff, 54, gathered his team and said endearingly, \u201cYou little rag knots are going to the semifinals.\u201d\n\nThe Iraan traveling party began to disperse for the long ride home. Six cheerleaders went with their parents. Six others boarded a small bus that did not have seatbelts, according to school officials. It was driven by Ms. Garlock, the varsity sponsor. Her sister, Ms. Pope, also rode along. The players headed to a nearby Mexican restaurant for a late meal.\n\nMr. Allen, the school superintendent, drove west with his wife on Interstate 20 and glanced at the speedometer on his Chevy Suburban. It said 75, the posted speed limit, but it felt too fast in the rain and the spray of heavy truck traffic. He was thinking of the game and said he told himself to slow down, to concentrate on the road: \u201cThis is tailor-made for something horrible.\u201d\n\nAt the Mi Ranchito restaurant, players ate chicken and beef fajitas and sopaipillas for dessert. Ms. Panich-Linsman and I sat at a table near the front. The mood was happy but subdued. Christmas music played in the background. Then the room grew quiet. Players began to gather around a table in the center of the restaurant.\n\nClayton Kent, 18, Iraan\u2019s quarterback, had received a somber call from his mother. The cheerleader bus had been in a wreck. Kent\u2019s 15-year-old sister, Katie, had been aboard. She was conscious but there were few details. Pray for everyone, his mother told him.\n\n\u201cI was scared to death,\u201d Kent would say later.\n\nThe accident had occurred near Big Spring, Tex., about 40 miles west of the stadium. Coach Kirchhoff said, \u201cLet\u2019s come together and pray for our girls.\u201d The players stood silently, heads bowed, holding hands or gripping a teammate\u2019s shoulder.\n\nAccording to the Texas Department of Public Safety, the driver of a tractor-trailer, traveling eastbound on Interstate 20, tried to avoid a car that braked in front of him. The 18-wheeler lost control, strayed across the median into the westbound lanes and collided with the cheerleader bus.\n\nKurt Hanna, Iraan High\u2019s technology director, was traveling two cars or so behind the cheerleaders. He saw a confusion of brake lights, and a crash, then realized that the bus was from Iraan. His wife, Melissa, called 911 at 10:34 p.m.\n\nWhen Mr. Hanna approached the bus, he said one cheerleader was already outside. She appeared dazed and hurting. He opened the back exit of the bus and saw a scattering of backpacks and large letters that spelled \u201cBraves.\u201d Everything seemed pushed forward. Most of the cheerleaders were not responsive at first. They seemed to Mr. Hanna to have been lying down, probably trying to rest on the trip home. Some appeared to have slid under the seats. Two were in the aisle, one atop the other.\n\n\u201cIt got worse as I went up,\u201d Mr. Hanna said.\n\nHe declined to discuss Ms. Pope, the deceased, out of respect for her family. Ms. Garlock appeared calm and alert but was pinned in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Mr. Hanna said he asked, and Ms. Garlock replied yes, but \u201cI\u2019m smashed in here. Can you help me?\u201d\n\nMr. Baum, the principal at Iraan High, soon arrived. He described Ms. Garlock as full of energy in her job at the school\u2019s computer lab, a \u201cfireball\u201d who laughed easily and worked efficiently. But she was pinned so tightly in the wreck, he said, that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t wiggle; she couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Her face, he said, was about an inch from the tractor-trailer.\n\n\u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d Mr. Baum said he asked, and Ms. Garlock replied, \u201cNo, but I know I will be.\u201d\n\nIt took rescuers with hydraulic tools about an hour and a half to extricate her from the bus. School officials said she was suspected to have sustained multiple fractures.\n\n\u201cShe knew she couldn\u2019t panic,\u201d Mr. Baum said. \u201cShe had teenage girls who were listening to her.\u201d\n\nBecause the 18-wheeler had straddled the westbound lanes of Interstate 20, he said, Ms. Garlock \u201chad nowhere to go\u201d to avoid a collision.\n\nMs. Garlock\u2019s daughter, Lauren, a senior cheerleader, was safe. She had ridden with her father. Her two sons, Steven, a senior football player and Lauren\u2019s twin, and Ryan, a freshman player, were driven 45 minutes by coaches from the restaurant to Big Spring. Their mother and the injured cheerleaders had been taken there initially, to Scenic Mountain Medical Center.\n\nThe lobby was filled with parents and relatives and concerned fans, many still wearing red Iraan football T-shirts. Outside, in the chilly drizzle, two cheerleaders who had not been on the bus cried on the shoulders of their mothers. School officials hugged and wept as they spoke of Ms. Pope, whose death had been confirmed.\n\n\u201cYou feel crushed, like an elephant is sitting on your chest and you can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t think,\u201d said Tracey Myers, 51, Iraan High\u2019s cross-country coach.\n\nMs. Pope and Ms. Garlock, whose maiden name was Castaneda, had grown up in a large family of seven girls and three boys, according to a nephew. The sisters had attended Iraan High, and although Ms. Pope\u2019s two children were now adults, she remained involved with the school. As president of the booster club, she brought food to cross-country meets and made sure there was enough chili at the concession stand for football games. She also designed T-shirts for each round of the playoffs.\n\nAs she left the stadium, Ms. Pope had already begun to line up orders for T-shirts for the state semifinals.\n\n\u201cShe was the last person I hugged,\u201d said Tammy Kirchhoff, 51, Iraan High\u2019s track coach and the wife of the football coach. \u201cShe was going to send those T-shirt orders out Monday morning. She loved the Braves.\u201d\n\nThe most seriously injured were transferred late Friday to University Medical Center in Lubbock, Tex. Kamie Klassen said her daughter, Kiara, 15, a cheerleader who had finished 20th at the recent cross-country state championships, had sustained a fractured skull, a fractured cheekbone and bruised lungs. But, she added, \u201cShe\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d\n\nAnd then Ms. Klassen expressed a sentiment that would be repeated by many as she left Scenic Mountain Medical Center. There was something familiar and reassuring to be found in continuing the football season. \u201cWe\u2019re still a team and we\u2019ll persevere,\u201d she said.\n\nHalee DeGraffenreid, 17, had been one of the more fortunate cheerleaders. She stood in the lobby of the medical center with a gash across her nose and her arm in a sling. She had needed stitches in her elbow but otherwise seemed O.K., her mother said.\n\nHalee had been listening to music and trying to sleep on the bus when she felt a sudden braking and hurtled forward. \u201cI heard a lot of crying and screaming,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was on top of each other. It was real scary.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, Halee felt queasy. She sat down in a wheelchair and doctors took her to an examining room before releasing her half an hour later, according to Mr. Baum, the principal.\n\nSometime after midnight, highlights from the Iraan-Munday game appeared on television in the hospital lobby. The Iraan fans turned their eyes to the screen but watched with blank stares. At about 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, the Pope and Garlock families left a small room off the lobby. Relatives hugged them and they cried without words.\n\nLate Saturday morning, the football players met at Iraan High School. Clayton Kent, the quarterback, said his sister Katie had two broken vertebrae in her lower back and a sore neck but was expected to be O.K. They had spoken briefly on the phone.\n\nCoach Mark Kirchhoff gave other updates: Ms. Garlock had been stabilized overnight and doctors were operating on her legs. She was expected to recover. None of the cheerleaders\u2019 injuries appeared life-threatening.\n\n\u201cThe emotional swing last night was crazy,\u201d Coach Kirchhoff told his players. \u201cI can tell you how I\u2019m feeling. You have sort of a guilty feeling in that you\u2019ve got that feeling of euphoria and happiness for the game. And then the other swing of the pendulum, the surreal, what-the-hell-just-happened tragedy. It conflicts you inside.\u201d\n\nBut, he assured his players, \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about last night and the win and going to the semifinals, that\u2019s O.K. I know I\u2019ve had that thought, \u2018Semifinals, man, semifinals,\u2019 and then thinking, \u2018My mind shouldn\u2019t be going there.\u2019 But it\u2019s going to.\u201d\n\nBy Sunday, at least 10 high schools in West Texas had offered to have their cheerleaders cheer for Iraan in Friday\u2019s semifinal game in Abilene. The offers are greatly appreciated and the cheerleaders will likely be welcomed, perhaps to sit in the stands, said Mr. Allen, the superintendent, but Iraan wants to get back on its own feet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the West Texas mentality,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may knock us down, but we ain\u2019t staying down.\u201d\n", "poor dinners picky business models panic eater attending role grownup seek children worry adults": "\nChildren are known for being picky eaters. But what happens when these picky eaters grow up?\n\nMany children leave behind their quirky eating habits as they get older. But \u201cwhat is less certain are the predictors of who will remain a picky eater in adulthood,\u201d said Nancy Zucker, a psychologist and director of the Duke Center for Eating Disorders. She is the lead author of a 2015 study that linked picky eating in some preschoolers with emotional problems.\n\nAdults may hang on to their youthful food dislikes \u2014 at the top of the list are vegetables \u2014 but then add more restrictions, such as consuming only smooth foods or limiting their diet to bland, white meals. Dr. Zucker said that in a sample of 2,600 adults who identified themselves as picky eaters, 75 percent reported the pattern started in childhood.\n\nThe estimates of picky eating in childhood vary widely, ranging from 5 percent to more than 25 percent, depending on the definition of selective eating. But \u201cthere is no consensus on the prevalence in adults,\u201d Dr. Zucker said. One reason is that many adults try to keep their picky eating a secret, a common source of stress that can lead to personal or professional problems.\n\nAs a child, Stephanie Lucianovic, the author of \u201cSuffering Succotash: A Picky Eater\u2019s Quest to Understand Why We Hate the Foods We Hate,\u201d would hide vegetables or hold her nose during meals. As an adult, her selective eating posed new challenges when she fell in love with a man from a \u201cfoodie\u201d family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really scary thing to overcome,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t choosing to dislike food. There\u2019s a lot of shame involved. There\u2019s not a lot of empathy for picky eaters.\u201d\n\nMs. Lucianovic said the key to ending her pickiness at the table was having the support of a nonjudgmental partner and learning how to cook. She still avoids steamed vegetables, but now enjoys them roasted or saut\u00e9ed. \u201cYou can reset the pattern of likes and dislikes,\u201d she said. \u201cI did it by continuing to try things in different ways.\u201d\n\nResearchers at Duke and the University of Pittsburgh are studying adult picky eaters via an online questionnaire. Among the questions: \u201cDo you get anxious about social situations because you will be expected to eat?\u201d and \u201cDo you gag when tasting a disliked food?\u201d About 40,000 adults have completed the survey.\n\nThe causes of long-term picky eating, however, remain poorly understood. In some cases, a childhood dining scare from choking or vomiting may cause lingering fear of one or more foods. \u201cFood memories are very powerful memories,\u201d Dr. Zucker said, adding that social anxiety associated with picky eating seems to increase with age.\n\nOther people may have a heightened sensitivity \u201cor even somewhat distorted perception to certain tastes and smells,\u201d said Juyun Lim, an associate professor of food science and technology at Oregon State University whose research has focused on the role of the senses in food preferences.\n\nAll foods contain tens to hundreds of volatile compounds that determine aroma and flavor, she said. But the same food can be perceived differently by two individuals.\n\n\u201cDepending on your genetics, a food can smell pleasant or unpleasant,\u201d Dr. Lim said. While one person may enjoy the taste of cilantro, for example, another might find it soapy. Another example is pork, which contains a compound that some people can\u2019t detect, or describe as pleasantly floral, while others characterize it as smelling like sweat or urine.\n\nSometimes we learn to like something the more we are exposed to it. \u201cThe first time you drink beer, it never really tastes good,\u201d Dr. Lim said.\n\nTexture also plays a role in food acceptance. One example is okra, with its slimy quality that many find disagreeable. Jane Kauer, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, was surprised when research revealed that some adults rejected raw tomatoes for reasons that had nothing to do with flavor. Participants described being turned off by the \u201cgross thing that happens when you pierce a tomato and the guts come out of it.\u201d\n\nMany adult picky eaters want to change, but they find certain foods too unappealing to even put on a plate. In extreme cases, they may shun nearly all foods, a condition the American Psychiatric Association calls avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, or Arfid.\n\nDr. Zucker said some adult picky eaters come to the Duke center for help when they are concerned about being poor role models for their children, for example, or they panic about attending business dinners. Psychologists and social workers help patients gain insight into the biological, emotional and social factors behind their selective eating.\n\n\u201cA person\u2019s experiences often need to be validated and fully understood before changes are even considered,\u201d Dr. Zucker said. New foods are then slowly introduced in an effort to expand the palate.\n\nDr. Zucker compared the process to physical rehabilitation for an injury, requiring much work and practice. Patients who have eaten only smooth foods may, for example, need to consult with an occupational therapist to learn how to chew and swallow more effectively. They are also taught ways of handling situations like eating in public or explaining their food preferences to others.\n\nOne thing experts advise: Don\u2019t push food at adult picky eaters. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly stressful to them, because most of us are perfectly happy to say, \u2018Come on, try it. It really tastes great,\u2019\u201d Dr. Kauer said.\n\nWhile loved ones\u2019 concern is understandable, selective eaters consider it intrusive and an attack on their sense of self, Dr. Kauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting into their space, and it has nothing to do with you.\u201d\n", "squander lead knicks win early games kings prevail eighth": "\nJeff Hornacek, the Knicks\u2019 coach, has recently become a believer in the philosophy that less is more. Instead of peppering his players\u2019 minds with repeated reminders of their flaws, he has decided that ignoring the shortcomings may be best. After all, he says, the Knicks were poor free-throw shooters until they finally just stopped talking about it.\n\nNow, he is hoping that ignorance can be the Knicks\u2019 weapon against their newest foible. For the fourth consecutive game, New York let a sizable lead evaporate. It has become a nightly question hanging over the Knicks\u2019 heads for the last week: How large a lead did they need to avoid blowing it and then scrambling to hold onto a win? Each night, they have failed to provide an answer.\n\nAn 11-point first-quarter advantage over the Thunder on Monday was not large enough. Up by 17 points in the fourth quarter in Minneapolis on Wednesday, they needed a last-second lifesaver from Carmelo Anthony. A 16-point first-quarter lead against the Timberwolves on Friday did not stand the test. But on Sunday, when the Knicks pushed a second-quarter lead over the Sacramento Kings to 21 points, it seemed safe.\n\nInstead, the lead was just a starting point for another precipitous drop.\n\nThe Knicks still won, just as they had in their last two games, but the 106-98 victory over the Kings at Madison Square Garden was gory. Over a six-minute span in the third quarter, a 20-point lead shrank to 1 point after an 18-point Sacramento run. Brandon Jennings and Derrick Rose had to stop the bleeding in the fourth quarter for the Knicks to pull out the victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a line drive in the score book, right?\u201d Hornacek said, smiling.\n\nStill, it required a group effort to overcome DeMarcus Cousins, who finished with 36 points (though it took him 30 shots) and 12 rebounds.\n\nThe win, unseemly as it was, was the Knicks\u2019 eighth in their last 11 games, eradicating the stench of a slow season start. Over that 11-game stretch, no Eastern Conference team has had a better record.\n\nLeading up to Sunday night, the Knicks had spoken often about their midgame disappearing acts. The topic was unavoidable, and apparently the discussions were not so useful.\n\nTheir defense, which Hornacek had pointed to as the key for preserving the leads, was barely visible against the Kings. The fourth quarter became another gut check rather than an opportunity for Hornacek to rest his starters and watch the minutes trickle down.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to get the stress off everybody for the fourth quarter,\u201d Kristaps Porzingis said. \u201cBut that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\nBy now, the Knicks understand their shortcomings. They have come to marking wins with dark humor. If not for 20 points from Rose, 20 more from Anthony and 19 from Jennings, things would have been bleaker. When Jennings pulled off a shake-and-bake move against Matt Barnes at the top of the key with 7 minutes 55 seconds remaining and then hit a three-point, the Knicks had a 5-point lead and the buffer they needed.\n", "social anxiety italy leaders disseminate media parties political provokes spread determine fake news propaganda european": "\nROME \u2014 Anxiety about bogus news reports is rising in Europe, as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy and others express concern that fake news circulated over social media may influence elections on the Continent, including a critical referendum in Italy on Sunday.\n\nThe outcome of the Italian vote, which could determine the fate of Mr. Renzi\u2019s government, may also affect the stability of European financial markets and further weaken the moorings of the European Union.\n\nLeaders on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to determine whether political parties are using social media platforms to deliberately disseminate propaganda, and whether there are connections to the agendas of outside powers, including Russia.\n\nAnalysts in the United States have suggested that Moscow injected fake news into social media sites there as a powerful weapon to influence the November election, including bogus reports that may have helped hand Donald J. Trump the presidency.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s goal in Europe is to radicalize politics, analysts say, breaking the liberal consensus and strengthening his regional influence.\n\nAs early as April, Mr. Renzi complained privately to his counterparts about Russia meddling in his country\u2019s politics by supporting anti-establishment parties.\n\nIn November, he privately discussed the spread of fake news with other European leaders and President Obama at a meeting in Berlin. Mr. Obama forcefully assailed the phenomenon while standing beside Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who has warned of Russian misinformation campaigns that \u201ccould play a role\u201d in her own re-election bid.\n\nMr. Renzi\u2019s private concerns were relayed by several current and former officials with knowledge of the conversations who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nHis biggest domestic opponent has been the surging and anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which would benefit most should he lose Sunday\u2019s referendum on streamlining Italy\u2019s bureaucracy.\n\nLaura Boldrini, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament, said she had no information about whether the Five Star Movement trafficked in fake news or promulgated Russian propaganda. But she did say it was a growing problem in Italy.\n\n\u201cFake news is a critical issue and we can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d she said this week. \u201cWe have to act now.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Boldrini met with Richard Allan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of public policy in Europe, to discuss ways Facebook could limit hate speech and fake news on its pages.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t pretend that they are just a platform,\u201d Ms. Boldrini said. \u201cThey are giant media companies.\u201d\n\nBuzzfeed and the Italian newspaper La Stampa recently reported that blogs, social media accounts and websites in Russia connected to the Five Star Movement were spreading fake news harmful to Mr. Renzi across their vast virtual networks.\n\nRussia has long had close relations with Italy, especially under Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister and media tycoon who was a personal friend of Mr. Putin.\n\nThese days, Mr. Putin\u2019s government appears much friendlier to anti-establishment opposition figures, like Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, who opposes sanctions on Russia and speaks proudly of his visits to Moscow.\n\nMr. Salvini said he has never received any financial assistance from Russia and called his alignment with Mr. Putin\u2019s party \u201cgeopolitical and free.\u201d Asked if Mr. Putin could be meddling in the referendum, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t even think he knows it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Putin has met with Mr. Renzi, whose office denied expressing worry to world leaders about Russian meddling in Italian politics, the Russian government appears to be especially welcoming to the Five Star Movement.\n\nThe party, born as an online movement, was co-founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died this year.\n\nToday Mr. Casaleggio\u2019s internet and publishing company, Casaleggio Associati, controls several widely viewed websites that often pick up sensational reports found on Sputnik Italia, an Italian version of the Kremlin-created website that projects Mr. Putin\u2019s worldview.\n\nOne such website, called Tze Tze, which has well over a million Facebook followers, recently ran an article titled, \u201cIs the U.S. trafficking migrants into Italy?\u201d\n\nTze Tze makes no mention of its connection to the Five Star Movement, claiming instead to be an independent news outlet. On Friday, a good deal of the site was dedicated to excoriating Mr. Renzi.\n\nThe constellation of Five Star Movement sites recently lit up with a video that appeared on Russia Today, purporting to show thousands of people protesting against the referendum. In fact, the people had gathered in support of Mr. Renzi and his reform.\n\nMr. Grillo, who has the most widely read blog in Italy, recently posted a picture of a packed Naples piazza and a headline suggesting the crowds had come to protest Mr. Renzi. \u201cA sea of humanity in the square, the people can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was a picture of a large audience gathered to hear Pope Francis speak.\n\n\u201cThe accusations of doing pro-Kremlin propaganda and spreading fake news is ridiculous,\u201d a post on Mr. Grillo\u2019s blog said this week. Supporters of the party believe its opponents have orchestrated an elaborate smear campaign in the news media.\n\nMr. Grillo went on to argue that the websites in question had no official link to his party, as did other leaders in the Five Star Movement, including Luigi Di Maio, a potential rival of Mr. Renzi.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Di Maio, the deputy president of the lower house of Parliament, dismissed Italian reports linking his party to anti-Renzi sites. On the question of Russian influence, he said that his party was not \u201cRussian-aligned or American-aligned.\u201d\n\nHis spokesman, Augusto Rubei, underlined that there had been only one official institutional visit to Moscow on the part of the Five Star Movement and another by a \u201csimple deputy, who went there personally.\u201d\n\nThe deputy in question, Manlio Di Stefano, the head of the party\u2019s foreign affairs committee, attended a conference for Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia United party.\n\nHe recently posted on the Five Star Movement blog that NATO was secretly preparing a \u201cfinal assault\u201d on Russia.\n\nLia Quartapelle, a member of Parliament in Mr. Renzi\u2019s Democratic Party who also sits on the foreign affairs committee, said that its Five Star Movement members \u201care full Russian.\u201d\n\nShe said they advocate an exit from NATO and quote Russia\u2019s foreign minister on questions about Syria. \u201cThey use the Russian propaganda,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Five Star Movement has a history of entertaining conspiracies.\n\nIn an interview over the summer, Mr. Renzi noted that on the anniversary of American astronauts first landing on the moon, one of the party\u2019s members in Parliament \u201csaid it was a conspiracy by the Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother one of them said she believes the sirens are still in the Mediterranean,\u201d he added.\n\nBut some of Mr. Renzi\u2019s detractors, even in his own party, argue that he is the delusional one.\n\nMassimo D\u2019Alema, a former Communist who was prime minister in the 1990s, scorns Mr. Renzi as a centrist in leftist clothing and is working to defeat him in the referendum. He said he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if Russia had anything to do with the fake news flooding Italy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there is dark organized center, a group of hackers in the Kremlin trying to affect the Italian referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they could care less.\u201d\n", "attempted criminal woman accused monday charges arrested year abortion yocca coathanger tennessee guilty faces attempt pleaded include anna": "\nA Tennessee woman who is accused of trying to abort her fetus at 24 weeks with a coat hanger last year is facing new felony charges, in a case that has raised concerns among some abortion-rights advocates over strict abortion laws.\n\nThe case concerning the woman, Anna Yocca, 32, has wound its way through the courts in Rutherford County for nearly a year, seesawing between multiple charges in three indictments as she has continued to sit in a central Tennessee jail.\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Yocca was arraigned on new charges: aggravated assault, an attempt to procure a miscarriage and an attempted criminal abortion. She entered a plea of not guilty, The Daily News Journal reported.\n\nMs. Yocca\u2019s public defender, Gerald Melton, did not respond to multiple requests for comment by email or telephone. Hugh Ammerman, the Rutherford County assistant district attorney who is prosecuting the case, could not be reached early on Tuesday.\n\nMs. Yocca was first charged on Dec. 8, 2015, with the attempted murder of her 24-week-old fetus in September 2015. She was booked into the Rutherford County jail, where she has remained, with bond set at $200,000. She is expected to return to court on Dec. 9, The Journal reported.\n\nThe case has pitted abortion-rights advocates against defenders of the state\u2019s anti-abortion laws, which are among the strictest in the country.\n\nThe authorities have said that Ms. Yocca climbed into a bathtub in September 2015 and tried to \u201cself-abort\u201d her pregnancy, which caused her to bleed so profusely that she was taken to a hospital, The Murfreesboro Post reported, quoting a police report.\n\nThe baby, a boy, was delivered alive by cesarean section at the hospital, weighing 1.5 pounds, but he had injuries, The Murfreesboro Post reported. The police report, quoting unidentified physicians, blamed Ms. Yocca\u2019s probing with the hanger, but it offered no medical evidence for what the indictment called bodily injury, and similar health problems are often associated with extreme prematurity.\n\nWhen contacted for a copy of the report, Sergeant Kyle Evans, a spokesman for the Murfreesboro Police Department, referred calls to the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThe case has drawn attention to strict abortion laws, and in some cases the criminalization of the procedure, as President-elect Donald J. Trump prepares to take office. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to roll back the abortion rights guaranteed by the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, and he suggested  \u201cpunishment\u201d for abortion providers and their patients. In his first prime-time television interview after he won the presidency, he repeated his desire to see Roe v. Wade overturned and said, of women seeking abortions, \u201cWell, they\u2019ll perhaps have to go \u2014 they\u2019ll have to go to another state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that this is a very shocking case and one that is incredibly tragic,\u201d said Allison Glass, the director of Healthy and Free Tennessee, which promotes sexual health. \u201cThis is not a common case for Tennessee, but with the threat of Roe being overturned,\u201d she added, \u201cthat is absolutely where we are headed.\u201d\n\nTennessee Right to Life representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe baby was initially placed in foster care. Last week Rob Johnson, a spokesman for the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services, said by telephone that the child was \u201csafe\u201d but no longer in state custody. Citing confidentiality, he declined to answer further questions.\n\nThe law in Tennessee permits abortions after 24 weeks \u2014 about the limit for fetal viability outside the womb, doctors say \u2014 if the woman\u2019s life or health is at risk. It also requires women to receive state-directed counseling and wait 48 hours before the procedure, which necessitates multiple trips to a clinic.\n\nMs. Glass said that only four out of 95 counties in Tennessee had abortion clinics, and that Rutherford County was not one of them.\n\nLynn M. Paltrow, the executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, which is helping with Ms. Yocca\u2019s defense, said the case was one of several high-profile instances showing what can happen when prosecutors apply criminal law to women\u2019s pregnancies.\n\nLast year, an Indiana woman, Purvi Patel, was sentenced to 20 years in prison after she was convicted of feticide for taking pills to terminate her pregnancy, and then delivering a baby who, the jury found, died from neglect. The conviction was vacated on appeal.\n\nIn some states pregnant women have been charged with attempted feticide for falling down stairs; for not wearing a seatbelt; and for trying to commit suicide while pregnant, Ms. Paltrow said.\n\nIn Ms. Yocca\u2019s case, Ms. Paltrow said, \u201cIt is absolutely not clear to us that her intention was to have an abortion, as opposed to having an early birth at home, or some other reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the problem around the criminal justice system being involved in pregnancy outcomes,\u201d she added. \u201cIn a country where more and more things have been criminalized, there is a virtually limitless number of crimes that prosecutors can chose from if we allow pregnancy to become the subject of criminal justice and court systems.\u201d\n", "cognitive study gardenvariety helped suggests benefit therapist therapy behavior online report insomniacs finds talk": "\nThe same digital screens that have helped nurture a generation of insomniacs can also help restore regular sleep, researchers reported on Wednesday. In a new study, more than half of chronic insomniacs who used an automated online therapy program reported improvement within weeks and were sleeping normally a year later.\n\nThe new report, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, is the most comprehensive to date suggesting that many garden-variety insomniacs could benefit from the gold standard treatment \u2014 cognitive behavior therapy \u2014 without ever having to talk to a therapist. At least one in 10 adults has diagnosable insomnia, which is defined as broken, irregular, inadequate slumber at least three nights a week for three months running or longer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an insomniac all my life, I\u2019ve tried about everything,\u201d said Dale Love Callon, 70, known as Dacie, a math tutor living in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., who recently used the software. \u201cI don\u2019t have it 100 percent conquered, but I\u2019m sleeping much better now.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have found that online sleep therapy can be effective, but most have been smaller, or focused on a particular sleep-related problem, like depression. The new trial tested the digital therapy in a broad, diverse group of longtime insomniacs whose main complaint was lack of sleep. Most had used medication or supplements over the years, and some still did.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest that there are a group of patients who can benefit without the need of a high-intensity intervention,\u201d like face-to-face therapy, said Jack Edinger, a professor in the department of medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver, who was not a part of the study. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet exactly who they are \u2014 the people who volunteer for a study like this in first place are self-motivated \u2014 but they\u2019re out there.\u201d\n\nIn the study, led by researchers at the University of Virginia, doctors recruited 303 people ages 21 to 65 over the internet. Half were randomly assigned to receive education and advice on insomnia \u2014 a digital \u201cplacebo,\u201d of sorts, though an active one, in that such advice often helps people sleep better. The other half got a six-week focused online therapy product, called SHUTi.\n\nSome of the researchers, as well as the university, have a stake in this product, which costs $135 for 16 weeks of access. None of those connected to the company analyzed the data or had access to it, or participated in the data analysis, said Lee Ritterband, the lead author and a developer of the online therapy.\n\nSHUTi is not the only digital insomnia therapy product on the market. Sleepio, which costs $300 for a year\u2019s access, and is offered by a London-based company, also incorporates cognitive therapy. And it was also found in a randomized study to have good results.\n\nBoth incorporate the techniques of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, an approach therapists have been using successfully for years. Some of those techniques date back decades. One is called sleep restriction, in which people set a regular \u201csleep window\u201d and work to stick to it. Another is called stimulus control, an attempt to break the association between lying in bed and activities like streaming video and eating.\n\nFinally, the therapy aims to undermine self-defeating assumptions about sleep, like \u201cWithout a good night\u2019s sleep, I can\u2019t function the next day\u201d or \u201cMedication is probably the only solution to sleeplessness.\u201d The program prompts people to log in daily and record each night\u2019s sleep in some detail; it then tailors weekly sessions based on those entries.\n\nMs. Love Callon\u2019s problem, for example, still wakes up in the middle of the night, at 4 a.m. or thereabouts. The online program, she said, instructed her to get out of bed when that happened, and sit and read for 40 minutes \u2014 which is more likely to induce sleepiness than, say, shopping online. \u201cAnd it has worked,\u201d she said. \u201cI get drowsy while reading and have been able to go back to bed and fall asleep.\u201d\n\nThe research team tracked the participants, assessing their sleep quality every several months, using standardized questionnaires. After a year, 57 percent of the people using the online therapy program were sleeping normally, compared with 27 percent of those who had gotten only advice and education.\n\n\u201cWe continued to see improvement from the six-month assessment through the end of the year, even though people had stopped using the program,\u201d Dr. Ritterband said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s a very good sign.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dr. John Torous, co-director of the digital psychiatry program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, there are about a dozen online programs on the market using cognitive behavior therapy techniques \u2014 for a variety of conditions, including depression \u2014 which also have rigorous evidence behind them.\n\n\u201cThere are maybe ten thousand or so mental apps out there, and the number is increasing way faster than the evidence base,\u201d Dr. Torous said, \u201cso it\u2019s good to see someone doing careful studies.\u201d\n\nDr. Torous said the one caveat for all of them is adherence. \u201cWhen you stop paying people to be in a study, when they stop getting reminder phone calls, they often stop doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a gym membership that way; people may do it twice and then let it go.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the potential of online therapies to reach huge numbers of people makes it likely that they will become first-line therapy in many cases, some experts say.\n\n\u201cDespite reasons for restraint, it seems inevitable that internet CBT-I will be increasingly used as a first-line insomnia intervention,\u201d concluded an editorial accompanying the study in the journal. \u201cIt also seems likely that the medical community may have little influence on whether, when, and how this occurs.\u201d\n", "late apologizes critics mea haitis cholera culpa disease general brought mention role kimoon ban outbreak haiti avoided secretary": "\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 After six years and 10,000 deaths, the United Nations issued a carefully worded public apology on Thursday for its role in the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti and the widespread suffering it has caused since then.\n\nThe mea culpa, which Secretary General Ban Ki-moon delivered before the General Assembly, avoided any mention of who brought cholera to Haiti, even though the disease was not present in the country until United Nations peacekeepers arrived from Nepal, where an outbreak was underway.\n\nThe peacekeepers lived on a base that often leaked waste into a river, and the first cholera cases in the country appeared in Haitians who lived nearby. Numerous scientists have long argued that the base was the source of the outbreak, but for years United Nations officials refused to accept responsibility.\n\nEven though Mr. Ban\u2019s office has acknowledged that the United Nations had played a role in the outbreak, his apology on Thursday was limited to how the world body responded to the outbreak, not how it started.\n\n\u201cWe simply did not do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and its spread in Haiti,\u201d Mr. Ban said on Thursday. \u201cWe are profoundly sorry about our role.\u201d\n\nApologies are rare for the United Nations. In 1999, Mr. Ban\u2019s predecessor, Kofi Annan, expressed \u201cdeep remorse\u201d for the organization\u2019s failure to protect civilians from the genocide in Rwanda five years earlier.\n\nMr. Ban\u2019s apology \u2014 belated in the view of his critics \u2014 is part of his push for redress in Haiti before the end of his 10-year tenure on Dec. 31. Yet the people of Haiti have seen few tangible benefits so far.\n\nThe United Nations has not yet met its promise to eradicate cholera once and for all from Haiti, though Mr. Ban\u2019s aides said on Thursday that they were close to raising the $200 million they say they need to fix Haiti\u2019s water and sanitation system and treat Haitians for cholera. Nor has the United Nations yet raised an additional $200 million it wants for \u201cmaterial assistance\u201d to families and communities that have suffered; donor nations have not yet come forward with the funds.\n\n\u201cIt is aimed at providing a meaningful \u2014 but necessarily imperfect \u2014 response to the impact of cholera on individuals, families and communities,\u201d Mr. Ban said in a report made public on Thursday.\n\nMr. Ban goaded countries to make \u201cvoluntary contributions,\u201d or else other means would have to be pursued, which can be interpreted only to be compulsory dues. \u201cEliminating cholera from Haiti, and living up to our moral responsibility to those who have been most directly affected, will require the full commitment of the international community and, crucially, the resources necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Haitian ambassador to the United Nations, Denis Regis, welcomed Mr. Ban\u2019s acknowledgment of the organization\u2019s role in the cholera outbreak, calling its previous position \u201cmorally unjustifiable.\u201d\n\nFew things have damaged the standing of the United Nations \u2014 and Mr. Ban\u2019s record as its secretary general \u2014 as the cholera outbreak and particularly, his response to it.\n\nIn a country where few people have access to clean water and proper sanitation, the disease quickly spread in 2010 when United Nations peacekeepers failed to adequately follow protocols for disposing wastewater, while deployed in Haiti. Cholera surged again in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which hit the nation in October.\n\nOne of the reasons the disease spread so widely, public health experts have said, is because it was allowed to; had there been a vigorous response in the first couple of years, it would have been far easier to contain, and fewer people would have died. The death toll stands at an estimated 10,000; some say it could be higher.\n\nIn the report issued on Thursday, Mr. Ban blamed perennial underfunding for cholera eradication. \u201cEfforts were beset from the start by the challenge of insufficient funding, which has had a dramatic negative impact on the capacity to respond effectively to the disease,\u201d he said.\n\nPerhaps most damaging to the United Nations, which regularly presses governments around the world to pursue accountability, Mr. Ban and his aides have all along claimed immunity from prosecution under a longstanding diplomatic treaty. That view was upheld in August by a federal court in Manhattan, in response to a class-action lawsuit by cholera victims.\n\nIn recent months, Mr. Ban has expressed \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d for the outbreak and \u201cdeep regret.\u201d Senior United Nations officials said they had been constrained from saying any more by their lawyers, who were concerned that it would make them vulnerable to further legal claims elsewhere over misconduct or mistakes by its peacekeepers.\n\nMr. Ban made the apology in English, French and Haitian Creole. It was delicately worded to avoid the impression that the United Nations was taking full responsibility for cholera in Haiti. That could imply legal culpability.\n\nThe group that represents the victims, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, has said it has not yet decided on whether to take the matter to the United States Supreme Court to seek compensation.\n\nBrian Concannon, the executive director of the group, called Mr. Ban\u2019s proposals a step in the right direction. \u201cBut words alone won\u2019t save lives or remove the stain on the U.N.\u2019s reputation,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThe U.N. and its member states will have to rise to the challenge and actually fund and effectively execute the projects.\u201d\n\nMr. Ban\u2019s aides have said they would prefer to use the material assistance funds to aid communities most affected by the cholera outbreak \u2014 by giving children of survivors a free education, for instance \u2014 rather than open up a fund for individual claims for compensation. Whatever they use it for, they need the money first. Of the estimated $200 million, only $500,000 has so far been pledged.\n", "proliferate great regional central distinct accents mcclellands detail midwestern minnesota book edward york slim guide speak": "\nLearning to speak Midwestern: Can there be any more urgent national task?\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t think so from all the postelection commentary laying Donald J.

Hillary Clinton\u2019s name appears only once, when he notes that he stumped for Bernie Sanders in Iowa but ultimately voted for Mrs. Clinton \u201cbecause we haven\u2019t had a president with an Inland North accent since Gerald Ford.\u201d\n\nStill, the book can be read as questioning the resurgent notion \u2014 perhaps strongest in the Midwest itself \u2014 that Midwesterners are the most authentically American of Americans, starting with their allegedly neutral speech.\n\n\u201cAccents are an important element of regional identity,\u201d Mr. McClelland writes. \u201cAnd an important element of Midwestern identity is believing you don\u2019t have an accent.\u201d\n\nFull disclosure: Like Mrs. Clinton, I\u2019m a white woman who grew up in the Chicago suburbs.

The tendency to pronounce final consonants without vibrating the vocal cords, made famous by the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d skit \u201cBill Swerski\u2019s Superfans\u201d and its paeans to \u201cda Bearsss\u201d (rather than \u201cda Bearzzz\u201d).\n\nLinguists divide the Midwest into three main regions, whose durable speech patterns reflect different waves of European settlement. The Inland North, initially settled by Yankees heading west from New England, is the most consistent region, with an accent that largely sounds the same from Rochester to Milwaukee. (It\u2019s also a region whose speech pulled subtly away from the rest of the country during the 20th century, thanks to a mysterious phenomenon known as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift.) The Midlands, which stretches from Pennsylvania and Ohio west to Kansas and Nebraska, shows much greater dialect diversity among cities, thanks to the clan-based social structure of the Scots-Irish, who began arriving via the port cities of the Mid-Atlantic States.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the North Central region (Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), which has a strong German and Scandinavian influence, though few people, Mr. McClelland reports, actually sound like characters in \u201cFargo.\u201d For superior Minnesotan, Mr. McClelland prefers the \u201cclipped, brisk, nasal\u201d speech of Kurt Russell in the hockey movie \u201cMiracle.\u201d\n\nMr. McClelland\u2019s introductory chapters on these three regions dangle plenty of fascinating tidbits. For example, studies have shown that working-class women show less pronounced regional accents than their husbands, perhaps because of greater contact with doctors, teachers and other professionals.\n\nAnd who knew that the lack of verb endings in Minnesota\u2019s remote Iron Range might be traceable to the polyglot immigrant mineworkers who, in a region lacking a base of native English speakers, had to cook up a mutually intelligible pidgin?\n\nThe glossaries, on the other hand, may come as a bit of a letdown to old-school wordniks. As a devotee of The Dictionary of American Regional English, I was disappointed to find Mr. McClelland\u2019s glossaries light on entries like \u201cdevil strip\u201d (as the grassy area between the sidewalk and the street is known in Akron, Ohio) and \u201cn\u2019 at\u201d (a Pittsburghism, short for \u201cand that,\u201d which is tacked on to the end of a sentence to mean \u201cet cetera\u201d).\n\nInstead, Mr. McClelland offers lots of place nicknames, sports-related slang and local delicacies. Not that they aren\u2019t useful: I, for one, plan to seek out mettwurst, a homemade cold-smoked ring sausage, next time I\u2019m in western Iowa. But the word lists come off less as language guides than cheery tourist-bureau advice.\n\nSo, whither the Midwestern tongue? One scholar Mr. McClellan interviews sees an erosion of its specific varietals, as young people identify more as Midwesterners than as Chicagoans or Buffalonians. Others see a weakening of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift.\n\nAs for Mrs. Clinton, in addition to heeding other portents, she might have taken note of the claim, cited here, that her native Inland North is losing linguistic dominance to the Midlands, which has become the \u201cgreat swing region of American accents.\u201d\n\nAs the Scandinavians in my Midwestern family tree might have put it (using an allegedly Norwegian term that, Mr. McClelland writes, is \u201cseldom heard in Norway\u201d): Uff da!\n", "directed deny climate accuses founder fiercest fire companys company descendants rockefellers conspiracy change threat scheming return mobil accused": "\nExxon Mobil, under fire over its past efforts to undercut climate science, is accusing the Rockefeller family of masterminding a conspiracy against it. Yes, that Rockefeller family.\n\nThe company, which has been accused of scheming to pay surrogates to deny the threat of climate change, is trying to turn the tables by calling its opponents the real conspirators. It is fighting state attorneys general, journalists and environmental groups in an all-out campaign to defend its image.\n\nBut the oil and gas giant has directed some of its fiercest fire at the descendants of John D. Rockefeller, who in 1870 founded Standard Oil, the company that became Exxon Mobil. Rockefeller family charities, longtime backers of environmental causes, have supported much of the research and reporting that has called the company to account for its climate policies, and Exxon Mobil is crying foul.\n\nThe pressure on the company is intense. Journalists have published expos\u00e9s of the company\u2019s research into climate change, including actions it took to incorporate climate projections into its exploration plans while playing down the threat. Such reporting projects, financed in part by Rockefeller family charities, included last year\u2019s work by Inside Climate News and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, which published its results with The Los Angeles Times. The findings have been boiled down to the popular Twitter shorthand #ExxonKnew.\n\nExxon Mobil, in public statements, court filings and thick dossiers on the company\u2019s opponents, says it is the target of a well-funded and politically motivated conspiracy to harm its core business.\n\nYet where Exxon Mobil and its allies see a tangled conspiracy, members of the Rockefeller family see an effort to use the vast wealth generated by fossil fuels to combat the damage done by fossil fuels.\n\nNow the family has taken the unusual step of going public to state its case in a rare interview and in a two-part essay in The New York Review of Books that lays out in detail Exxon Mobil\u2019s research and funding of climate denial. David Kaiser, an author of the essay and a fifth-generation Rockefeller, said dryly, \u201cThe family generally doesn\u2019t do public things in this way.\u201d\n\nHe said he was aware that the \u201cobvious historical irony of the fact that we are Rockefellers doing this would attract additional attention to the story \u2014 and we want attention to the story, because we think it will make clear to the public that the so-called debate over climate science has been a fake one, artificially manufactured, and a basically dishonest one from the beginning.\u201d\n\nState attorneys general, beginning last year with Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, began conducting fraud investigations that focus on whether the company\u2019s decades-long research into climate change, and the likelihood that energy companies will not be able to exploit all of their fossil fuel reserves, makes recent valuation of those reserves questionable. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission has launched its own investigation of the company\u2019s accounting of reserves.\n\nExxon Mobil says it has recognized the threat of climate change and the need to fight it for more than a decade; the company says it stopped funding the organizations that promote climate denial in the mid-2000s. It has also argued that its early research has been mischaracterized.\n\nThe company is attacking the role of the Rockefeller family in encouraging, and in some cases bankrolling, the investigations and campaigns against it. Both journalism organizations that investigated the company were financed, at least in part, by Rockefeller philanthropies, though the organizations say that their donors have no control over what they write.\n\nThe Rockefeller funds have also provided support to groups like Greenpeace and 350.org that have investigated and criticized the company.\n\nA conference in January to discuss activism and education efforts surrounding Exxon Mobil\u2019s climate work was held at the offices shared by two Rockefeller family funds. One potential subject of discussion suggested by a participant was \u201cto establish in public\u2019s mind that Exxon is a corrupt institution that has pushed humanity (and all creation) toward climate chaos and grave harm.\u201d\n\nAlan Jeffers, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said in an interview, \u201cAt every turn, as we saw the company coming under attack, there was a link back to either the Rockefeller Brothers Fund or the Rockefeller Family Fund.\u201d\n\nThe two philanthropies have  announced that they are divesting themselves of fossil fuels. When the family fund made its announcement in March, it denounced Exxon Mobil\u2019s \u201cmorally reprehensible conduct\u201d on climate change.\n\nMr. Jeffers responded, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re divesting from the company since they\u2019re already funding a conspiracy against us.\u201d\n\nThe company and its allies have turned up the heat on its founding family and other opponents.\n\nIndustry-backed policy groups like Energy in Depth generate stories that attack the family and its philanthropy. Their charges are echoed in conservative news outlets like The Wall Street Journal's opinion page and The Daily Caller. Breitbart News has called the collaboration among environmental groups to urge the investigation of Exxon a \u201cRICO conspiracy,\u201d using the acronym for the federal racketeering law, and the industry-oriented site Natural Gas Now published an article declaring, \u201cIt\u2019s time to RICO the Rockefellers.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s allies offer journalists what political operatives refer to as opposition research, including court records and favorable articles (as do activist groups opposing Exxon Mobil).\n\nExxon Mobil has also pulled the Rockefeller philanthropies into its legal battles against the attorneys general investigating it, sending the groups a subpoena demanding documents and communications related to their activism.\n\nA federal judge in Dallas, Ed Kinkeade, granted the company the right to pursue discovery in its cases against the state attorneys general. He ruled that comments by Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts at a news conference about the investigations in March, which also featured former Vice President Al Gore, may have shown that she was presupposing what an investigation would show, which may demonstrate that she acted in bad faith in pursuing the case. The judge has taken the exceptional step of ordering depositions of Ms. Healey and Mr. Schneiderman.\n\nThe Rockefeller funds have also received subpoenas from another friend of Exxon Mobil, the chairman of the House Science Committee, Rep. Lamar S. Smith, a Texas Republican. Mr. Smith has harshly criticized the attorneys general over their investigations, and has accused the Rockefeller funds of taking part in \u201ca coordinated effort to deprive companies, nonprofit organizations and scientists of their First Amendment rights and ability to fund and conduct scientific research free from intimidation and threats of prosecution.\u201d\n\nThe Rockefeller family responds that it is trying to right a historic social and environmental wrong, using the straightforward tools of the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Rockefeller Family Fund has exercised its freedom of speech in expressing our repugnance at Exxon Mobil\u2019s behavior,\u201d said Mr. Kaiser, the president of the fund. \u201cWe have exercised our freedom of association by talking with like-minded public interest advocates about how best to educate the public about the realities of climate change. And we have exercised our right to petition the government for redress of grievances by informing elected officials about our concerns that in the course of its climate science campaign, Exxon may have violated the law. All of those rights are explicitly guaranteed to us by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nHe said that within the clan \u2014 the direct descendants of John D. Rockefeller and their families number some 270 \u2014 he has received \u201cpassionate support\u201d for the fund\u2019s efforts, though he acknowledged, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from everyone in the family.\u201d\n\nOne family member, Ariana Rockefeller, called the efforts against the oil company \u201cdeeply misguided\u201d and said \u201cthey are counterproductive to our goal of protecting the environment by undermining Exxon\u2019s ongoing good work in clean and renewable energy.\u201d\n\nThe Rockefeller family has enthusiastically embraced the environmental movement since the 1960s, and has focused on climate change since the 1980s. The engagement with Exxon itself has been more gradual; members of the family tried for more than a decade, through conversations with company executives and through proxy measures, to get Exxon to take a stronger stance in favor of clean energy and, in the days when the company was expressing doubts in paid advertisements in The New York Times about climate science, to get it to stop.\n\nPeter Frumhoff, the director of science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group that published its own investigation of Exxon Mobil\u2019s efforts to promote uncertainty about climate science, said that his group had received \u201cmodest funding support\u201d over the years from the Rockefeller funds. He said that activism by the Rockefellers, because of their family connection to Standard Oil, made them \u201can essential voice,\u201d and that he and his group had received subpoenas from Exxon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve clearly hit a nerve, haven\u2019t we?\u201d he said.\n", "website thirdparty targeting ads progressive show consumer company data blame network breitbart hardright brands pitched technology find ad": "\nThe Vanguard Group does its best to stay away from politics when advertising, going so far as to have a policy against marketing on overtly partisan websites. So it was a surprise to Vanguard, an investment management company, when it found its ads on Breitbart News, the hard-right site that has become closely tied to President-elect Donald J. Trump.\n\nAn email from a client alerted Vanguard to the issue last week, prompting it to pull its ads from the site. Breitbart had been inadvertently included on a list of preapproved websites the company and its ad agency use to try to reach people who have visited Vanguard\u2019s site, said Emily Farrell, a spokeswoman.\n\nVanguard is one of at least a dozen companies, including prominent brands like Allstate, Kellogg and Warby Parker, that have said recently that they will stop advertising on Breitbart. The brands have attributed their appearances on the site to the automated nature of online advertising, in which a complicated system of third-party networks and agencies is used to place ads. That has cast a spotlight on how the zeal to capitalize on consumer data and advanced targeting technologies has resulted in some companies\u2019 being associated with sites they want to avoid.\n\nIt is increasingly rare for marketers and their agencies to place ads directly on websites. Unlike advertising on television or in magazines, where brands often choose placements in advance based on content, marketers online deploy sophisticated technologies to target and personalize ads in real time for the people who are most likely to be interested in their products or services, wherever they may be roaming on the web.\n\nKris Charles, a Kellogg representative, said that while the company reviewed sites for potential ad placements \u201cusing filtering technology to assess the words and phrases that make up a site\u2019s content,\u201d there is also \u201ca very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed.\u201d\n\nAll of this has resulted in the kind of publicity \u2014 and political repercussions \u2014 brands were hoping to avoid. After Kellogg said it would stop advertising on Breitbart because the site was not \u201caligned with our values as a company,\u201d pointing to publicly available marketing guidelines, Breitbart started a #DumpKelloggs boycott campaign. Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s chief executive, said in an editorial that the cereal maker \u201chas shown its contempt for Breitbart\u2019s 45 million readers and for the main street American values that they hold dear.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Breitbart did not respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\nAllstate responded to one consumer\u2019s complaint about its appearance on Breitbart by saying, \u201cUnfortunately, the nature of internet media buys is such that we are not always able to receive full disclosure with regards to all of the websites on which our advertising may run,\u201d though it would exclude Breitbart from its ad buys in the future. The eyeglass company Warby Parker blamed \u201cthird-party ad networks or ad exchanges,\u201d and affirmed its commitment to diversity and inclusivity. Other brands, including Nissan, have said they aim to reach as many customers as possible and do not plan to change their advertising strategy based on complaints from some consumers.\n\nThe nuances of how a brand ends up on a website, however, are often meaningless to consumers who may associate the two regardless of whether they have a direct relationship \u2014 which is being highlighted anew as tensions run high after the election.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, a Twitter account called \u201cSleeping Giants\u201d was created with the goal of choking off ad dollars going to Breitbart, urging people to screenshot ads on the site, then post those pictures and flag the advertisers. (The New York Times is among companies that have been criticized for advertising on the site.)\n\nWorkable, a start-up that sells recruiting software and champions diversity, was flagged by the account, which has roughly 6,000 followers, for having a banner ad on Breitbart above the headline, \u201cThere\u2019s No Hiring Bias Against Women in Tech, They Just Suck at Interviews.\u201d A screenshot of the ad was posted and sent to Nikos Moraitakis, Workable\u2019s chief executive, who said he \u201cnearly had a heart attack\u201d when he saw it.\n\nWorkable\u2019s ad ended up on the site through one of the Google companies that brokers web ads, and Workable has now added Breitbart to an \u201copt out\u201d list, Mr. Moraitakis said in an interview. But even as it has blocked Breitbart, \u201cthere\u2019s probably another 10 sites we haven\u2019t excluded,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe rely on our ad networks to keep the networks clean, and then obviously, the big ethical question is what clean means,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, these hate speech sites and fake news sites are a new breed, and I don\u2019t think Google has caught on to them.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe unfortunate side effect of this is that to the consumer, it looks like we are directing our advertising dollars to a specific media site.\u201d\n\nMost ads are placed based on data about the user rather than the content of the website, and limits are set after the fact \u2014 say, ensuring that brands do not show up next to pornography or neo-Nazi literature. This process is known as blacklisting, and because of the sheer number of websites, brands tend to value its efficiency over any qualms they may have about appearing in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\n\u201cThe blacklist approach starts with 500 billion impressions a day across the globe in real time across all screens and all formats; the white list approach starts with zero,\u201d said Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, a marketing technology company. \u201cSo it\u2019s, do you start with the universe, then filter, or start with nothing, then build up?\u201d\n\nTo some, that illustrates the underlying problem. Joe Marchese, president of advertising products for the Fox Networks Group, said that while audience profile \u201cmatters first and foremost,\u201d there \u201chas to be a better standard set for the environment\u201d where an ad will appear.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy so many sites that you don\u2019t know them all, there\u2019s almost no way to kind of guarantee you\u2019re not going to be supporting something fraudulent, sensationalist or alt-right or whatever the content happens to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe uproar about Breitbart with the separate issue of fake news sites has sent advertisers to online ad verification companies like DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. On Thursday, DoubleVerify added an \u201cInflammatory Politics & News\u201d category to a list of more than 75 categories that advertisers can choose to avoid. If selected, it will block ads from appearing on sites including Breitbart, Rawstory.com, WND.com, LibertyWritersNews.com and YoungCons.com, the company said.\n\n\u201cWith the surge in these new sites that are living on unsubstantiated stories that are oftentimes very politically charged, large brands are coming to us and ensuring that their ads don\u2019t appear on those kinds of sites,\u201d said Wayne Gattinella, the chief executive of DoubleVerify.\n\nBreitbart said in its editorial that Kellogg\u2019s move would have \u201cvirtually no revenue impact\u201d on the site. While at least one ad tech firm, AppNexus, has barred Breitbart from using its tools, citing a violation of its hate speech rules, data from Ghostery, a data governance company, shows that the site works with many ad tech companies. And while select brands have pulled away from the site, plenty of others remain.\n\nStill, John Montgomery, executive vice president for brand safety at the advertising giant WPP\u2019s GroupM, predicts that the price of ads on Breitbart could decline, affecting the company\u2019s revenue, if enough \u201cvenerable brands\u201d act.\n\n\u201cSince the Breitbart issue came up, we\u2019ve obviously been talking to our people internationally and making sure they have their clients understand if they don\u2019t want to be on political sites, we need to put them onto the blacklist,\u201d Mr. Montgomery said in an interview. \u201cParticularly after the publicity of the election there are many big brands who are having these discussions with agencies right now.\u201d\n", "features people snapchats big app messages send large started payday base user path disappear": "", "reddit network bans space media twitter safe hybrid conservative digital social bunker sorts gab built": "\nWhen the white nationalist leader Richard B. Spencer was suspended from Twitter recently, he hopped over to YouTube to address his supporters. \u201cDigitally speaking,\u201d he said, Twitter had sent \u201cexecution squads across the alt-right.\u201d He accused Twitter of \u201cpurging people on the basis of their views,\u201d calling it \u201ccorporate Stalinism.\u201d Then he mapped out a path forward. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously Gab, which is an interesting medium,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that will be the place where we go next.\u201d\n\nGab is a new social network built like a hybrid of Twitter and Reddit \u2014 posts are capped at 300 characters, and the crowd votes to boost or demote posts in the feed. But Gab\u2019s defining feature is its user guidelines, or rather, its lack thereof. Gab bans illegal activities \u2014 child pornography, threats of violence, terrorism \u2014 and not much else. \u201cFacebook, Twitter and Reddit are taking the path of censorship,\u201d Utsav Sanduja, Gab\u2019s chief communications officer, told me via email. \u201cGab does not.\u201d\n\nThink of Gab as the Make America Great Again of social sites: It\u2019s a throwback to the freewheeling norms of the old internet, before Twitter started cracking down on harassment and Reddit cleaned out its darkest corners. And since its debut in August, it has emerged as a digital safe space for the far right, where white nationalists, conspiracy-theorist YouTubers, and minivan majority moms can gather without liberal interference.\n\nThis election laid bare the ideological divide on social media, and since the election, the rift has deepened. Just as dejected Hillary Clinton supporters have come together in Pantsuit Nation \u2014 a \u201csecret\u201d Facebook group of nearly four million members \u2014 some on the right have found their postelection online oasis in the invitation-only Gab.\n\nGab\u2019s 25-year-old founder, Andrew Torba, dreamed up the site after reading reports that Facebook employees suppress conservative articles on the site. Mr. Torba \u2014 who previously created Kuhcoon, a system for running automated Facebook ad campaigns (it\u2019s now called Automate Ads) \u2014 is a rare conservative Christian tech C.E.O. Gab is a corrective to what he dubs \u201cBig Social,\u201d and it\u2019s based on what the company calls \u201ca pluralistic ethos of mutual respect and toleration of dissonant views.\u201d\n\nWhen other social sites push out disruptive users, Gab opens its arms. Recently, Twitter beefed up abuse rules to police not only threats but also hate speech \u201cagainst a race, religion, gender, or orientation.\u201d (The move presaged the purge that swept up Mr. Spencer.) And Reddit erased a community called Pizzagate, where conspiracy theorists had gathered to spin lies about Democratic pedophiles operating out of a D.C. pizzeria. On Gab, the topic is always trending.\n\nAll the big-name Twitter castaways have resurfaced here: In addition to Mr. Spencer, there is Milo Yiannopoulos, the Breitbart editor who was barred from Twitter for siccing trolls on the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d actress Leslie Jones; Pax Dickinson, the former Business Insider chief technology officer who rebranded himself as a victim of P.C. culture when he was sacked for posting sexist tweets; and Tila Tequila, the reality TV star who was booted from Twitter after posting racial slurs and pro-Nazi stuff. Gab has also attracted the cutting conservative commentator Ann Coulter; the right-wing media guerrilla Mike Cernovich; and the disinformation king Alex Jones, founder of Infowars. Gab now hosts 98,000 accounts, with tens of thousands more hopeful members on a wait list.\n\nRight-wing rhetoric pervades the site, even the lifestyle and sports categories. With more than 28,000 followers, Mr. Yiannopoulos is one of the site\u2019s biggest stars, though he rarely posts anything. On election night, Mr. Torba excitedly live-Gabbed Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory, then wrote, \u201cGab is going to be absolutely massive under President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe site has a broader conservative coalition than the largely young, mostly male crews camped out on Reddit\u2019s Trump forums or slithering around the anonymous message board 4chan. The Facebook factions have found a home here, too. Recently a woman named Lisa posted to Gab: \u201cHi folks. I\u2019m a #gabmom from Ohio and this is my 1st post. Still trying to figure the format out but thanks for the site Andrew!\u201d Her note has been up-voted more than 200 times. Gab\u2019s mascot is a frog, which Mr. Torba claims is based on religious and natural sources associating frogs with exodus and rebirth. Many users see it as a wink to Pepe the Frog, the internet cartoon that became a 4chan icon and \u2014 after being dressed up online in Nazi insignia \u2014 was declared a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. But plenty of non-meme-fluent Gab users just see it as a cute mascot, \u201cGabby.\u201d\n\nHigh on Mr. Trump\u2019s win, Gab users are pretty upbeat. Part of the reason that Gab\u2019s anti-anti-harassment rules work so well, so far, is that most people agree with one another. And one of those points of agreement is that anti-Semitism is tolerable, if not exactly preferred. On Twitter, anti-Semitic and racist trolls prowl around, pouncing on users while dodging the site\u2019s moderators. But on Gab, anti-Jewish rhetoric is slung casually and liberally. One user, angry that his content had just been downvoted, wrote, \u201cThanks to the #Jew that just stopped by.\u201d Andrew Auernheimer, a white supremacist troll known as weev, kicked off a minor censorship debate when Gab erased his bio, which advocated the rape, torture and murder of Jews. When one user advised weev to be more careful to avoid trouble with the law, another accused him of being Jewish.\n\nWhile mainstream social networks are promising to crack down on \u201cfake news,\u201d Gab clears the runway for posts like \u201cSatanic PizzaGate Is Going Viral Worldwide (Elites Are Terrified)\u201d to pick up speed. Ricky Vaughn, a pseudonymous white nationalist (he takes his name from Charlie Sheen\u2019s character in \u201cMajor League\u201d) also barred from Twitter, posted to Gab that Twitter is effectively dead and should now be used only to pull off \u201cskirmishes\u201d against Twitter denizens. Gab would be a convenient base for recruiting more digital foot soldiers to that cause.\n\nBehind the rah-rah free speech attitude, dissenting opinions on Gab are quashed in their own way. Overtly racist accounts were created by enemies to make Gab look bad, Mr. Torba said in a post. \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe have fake shill profiles attempting to play into the media narrative.\u201d\n\nBut some have worried that the site\u2019s insulation can dampen their message. \u201cNow that Twitter is purging everyone, I think it\u2019s important for Gab to branch out and attract leftists so we\u2019re not just preaching to the choir,\u201d wrote Paul Joseph Watson, editor at large at Infowars.\n\nWhen I asked why the site leans conservative, Mr. Sanduja denied that Gab had any ideological bent. \u201cWe challenge this premise completely \u2014 to the contrary, Gab has a number of diverse users globally,\u201d he wrote. (There is a politely argumentative Democrat who goes by the handle @Democrat, for instance.) But he added that right-wing users would be naturally drawn to Gab. \u201cWhen a group of people are being systematically dehumanized and labeled as the alphabet soup of phobias,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthey will look for a place that will allow them to speak freely without censorship and devoid of Social Justice bullying.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s the trick, isn\u2019t it? You can\u2019t sell a social destination where conservatives are free from liberal pestering and expect the pitch to resonate across the spectrum. Even the idea that harassment rules are oppressive \u2014 instead of protective of the vulnerable \u2014 is itself a pointed worldview. I suspect that any concern about inclusion will be assuaged by the comfort of chatting with people who think and talk the same way. It\u2019s the next logical step after all the blocking and muting on Twitter and filtering and unfollowing on Facebook split America into two social media realities. Where there once was a bubble, now there\u2019s a wall.\n", "set national washington playoff square college towering steadfast state supporting championship sights football game meet seasons clemson joined cast antihero ohio alabama semifinal": "\nBe it Don Draper of \u201cMad Men\u201d or Walter White of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d television audiences cannot seem to get enough of the beguiling antihero these days.

I didn\u2019t hold that sign up.\u201d\n\nShould the Huskies give way, Alabama\u2019s only hurdle will be the winner of the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz.: Clemson, the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s champion and the second seed, or Ohio State, a Big Ten team and the third seed. In either case, the title game would constitute a rematch of a recent playoff game.\n\nMack Brown, who won the 2005 season\u2019s national championship as Texas\u2019 coach \u2014 and lost to Alabama in the 2009 season\u2019s title game \u2014 said the Peach Bowl would be an excellent matchup, \u201cmuch better than people will give it credit for.\u201d\n\nWashington (12-1) has an offense led by the sophomore Jake Browning, who, now with two full regular seasons of experience, has thrown 42 touchdown passes this year, against seven interceptions. The Huskies also have the eighth-best scoring defense in the Football Bowl Subdivision, ceding just 17.2 points per game.\n\nThen again, Alabama is No. 1, at 11.8 points per game, and although Washington has played several ranked teams, it has faced no defense like that of the Crimson Tide, who also led the F.B.S. in yards per game (248) and defensive touchdowns (10, with five off fumbles and five off interceptions). They added four more scores on punt returns.\n\nThe results for the Crimson Tide and the Huskies against a common opponent offer a stark contrast. Alabama mauled Southern California, 52-6, in Arlington, Tex., in its season opener, in September. Two months later, the Trojans, who struggled early before finishing the season 9-3 and ranked ninth by the playoff committee, handed Washington its only loss, a 26-13 defeat in Seattle.\n\n\u201cU.S.C. was the underdog, came in with a chip on their shoulder,\u201d said Brown, now an ESPN commentator. \u201cThat\u2019s normally the part Washington plays.\u201d\n\nWhich is not to say the Peach Bowl will be close. The average margin of victory in the four semifinal games that have been played under the current system is 26 points \u2014 last year, the No. 2 seed Alabama blew out Michigan State, the Big Ten champion and the No. 3 seed, 38-0.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise,\u201d Brown said, \u201cwould be if we go to the fourth quarter with Alabama \u2014 can Washington get it close? Because if it is close, the pressure will be on Alabama.\u201d\n\nThe Fiesta Bowl looks like the more balanced semifinal, with similar teams led by experienced quarterbacks who are threats to run and to throw: Clemson\u2019s Deshaun Watson and Ohio State\u2019s J. T. Barrett.\n\nBoth the Tigers (12-1) and the Buckeyes (11-1) averaged more than 40 points per game on offense and were in the top 12 in the F.B.S. in scoring defense. Clemson\u2019s defense stands out for its tackles for a loss (8.6 per game, tied for third); Ohio State was second in defensive touchdowns to Alabama, with seven.\n\nBoth teams have playoff experience, with Ohio State winning the title for the 2014 season and Clemson finishing as the runner-up in January. Each of those runs included a game against Alabama: Ohio State beat the Crimson Tide, 42-35, in a semifinal, and Clemson lost, 45-40, in the title game.\n\nSaban has turned pessimism into an art form \u2014 and a motivational tactic \u2014 and on a conference call on Sunday, he pointed to several games this season that were close calls for Alabama: at Mississippi, which at one point led, 24-3; against Texas A&M, which took a 14-13 lead in the third quarter; and in Saturday\u2019s Southeastern Conference championship game against Florida, in which Alabama struggled on offense at first.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of difficult challenges this year that our players have had to persevere,\u201d Saban said. There are only two left.\n", "insert title dance highlights ella audacities brought rendering meet choreographers road stage": "\nOur downtown choreographers do not lack nerve. (In New York, \u201cdowntown\u201d dance includes Brooklyn.) With fabulous hubris, the choreographer Zvi Gotheiner, in his new piece, \u201cOn the Road,\u201d has tried rendering Jack Kerouac\u2019s 1957 novel as dance theater. With equal daring, the dancer-choreographer Caleb Teicher has set his new tap dance, \u201cMeet Ella,\u201d to recordings of Ella Fitzgerald at her most incandescent, live in Rome (1958) and Berlin (1960).\n\nAnd when Dylan Crossman was asked about his new work, \u201c[Insert Title],\u201d in a postshow talk, he wryly admitted that it had been a trio until he added a central role for himself at one week\u2019s notice, and that the music had arrived the day before the opening.\n\nAll three of these dances opened last week; all had glorious dancing. Mr. Gotheiner\u2019s 60-minute work ran at the Brooklyn Academy of Music\u2019s BAM Fisher space from Wednesday to Saturday, while between Thursday and Saturday, Mr. Crossman and Mr. Teicher shared a split-bill program, curated by David Parker, at Gibney Dance Studios.\n\nMr. Gotheiner\u2019s audacity is the most obvious. How do you turn any literary work into dance without failing right, left and center? Anyone who knows Kerouac\u2019s novel could watch this dance with a list of \u201cbuts\u201d accumulating in her head. Mr. Gotheiner would have spared himself trouble if he\u2019d chosen a different title.\n\nYet he made a good \u2014 often wonderful \u2014 dance. With a different title, he might still have evoked aspects of Kerouac while, in a good way, calling much else to mind. He introduced the \u201croad\u201d idea with unpeopled film, landscape hurtling past as if seen from a rushing car. Then, he gave us a two-tier dance, with dance onscreen (set in various landscapes) coexisting with dance onstage; the same dancers appeared in both. His chief subject is anthropological: the new American society of the Beat age, informal in manners and sexual suggestiveness. (At times Mr. Gotheiner labored too hard to make sure we noticed the bisexual currents amid his men.)\n\nHis dancers \u2014 his group is ZviDance \u2014 were vividly individual, marvelous (the men, especially) in showing two opposite physical impulses at the same time. I can\u2019t forget a solo in which one man, his back to us, danced as if his right shoulder and left foot were following different drummers, as if possessed. And Mr. Gotheiner caught the road theme in the ways dances passed across the stage with changing characters, and in the kinesthetically appealing combination of intense vitality and casual manners.\n\nChoreographers display no less courage (arrogance?) when they tackle great music \u2014 and, especially, great musicians in top form. There are hundreds of classic Fitzgerald recordings, but she\u2019s especially, and happily, aflame in the Rome and Berlin concerts. In one of the Berlin performance\u2019s extended cadenzas, laden with scat, she quotes highlights from her past as if this were an operatic mad scene.\n\nThere\u2019s no dancing version of Ms. Fitzgerald in Mr. Teicher\u2019s \u201cMeet Ella.\u201d This is a long male duet, in which he and Nathan Bugh, physically and stylistically unalike, dance together in soft-shoe tap style. (Though you can hear them, this tap dancing is not really for the ear.) Mr. Bugh, head shaven, almost always dances with an innocently happy smile but without looking the audience in the eye; the more youthful Mr. Teicher, with dark hair (and one white streak), is skillful and sly in the communicative use of his eyes and hands. The slyness never annoys; nothing here is overcalculated.\n\nEach man has solos, but there\u2019s also plenty of same-sex partnering, with lifts and supported turns. So there\u2019s deliberate ambiguity throughout: Are we watching a professional duo (the soft-shoe male duet has a long tradition) or a sexual couple?\n\nThough they don\u2019t represent Ms. Fitzgerald, they certainly meet her, sometimes dancing slow when she\u2019s scatting fast, sometimes tumbling, sliding, embellishing. The meters and body language keep changing. No, they\u2019re not on her level, and yet they help you listen more closely to her.\n\nThe independence of dance from music in Mr. Crossman\u2019s work has been widespread since Merce Cunningham and John Cage established the separate coexistence of the two in the 1950s; Mr. Crossman danced with the Cunningham troupe from 2009 to 2011. But you could feel the freshness of his experimentalism throughout: Was this a trio plus a solo, or was it a quartet?\n\nSome sections employed stasis, body language, a series of dramatic situations in which dancers moved from pose to pose. Others featured steps, and stretched one-leg balances. I mean it mainly as a compliment when I say I wanted \u201c[Insert Title]\u201d to last longer; what we saw felt like a prelude to something more substantial. Everything was compelling.\n", "peace magic cancer mushroom striking hallucinogen reduce results drug dose patients anxiety psilocybin studies depression lasting": "\nOn a summer morning in 2013, Octavian Mihai entered a softly lit room furnished with a small statue of Buddha, a box of tissues and a single red rose. From an earthenware chalice, he swallowed a capsule of psilocybin, an ingredient found in hallucinogenic mushrooms.\n\nThen he put on an eye mask and headphones and lay down on a couch. Soon, images flew by like shooting stars: a spinning world that looked like a blue-green chessboard; himself on a stretcher in front of a hospital; his parents, gazing at him with aching sadness as he reached out to them, suffused with childlike love.\n\nPsilocybin has been illegal in the United States for more than 40 years. But Mr. Mihai, who had just finished treatment for Stage 3 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, was participating in a study looking at whether the drug can reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Throughout that eight-hour session, a psychiatrist and a social worker from NYU Langone Medical Center stayed by his side.\n\nPublished Thursday, the results from that study, and a similar small, controlled trial, were striking. About 80 percent of cancer patients showed clinically significant reductions in both psychological disorders, a response sustained some seven months after the single dose. Side effects were minimal.\n\nIn both trials, the intensity of the mystical experience described by patients correlated with the degree to which their depression and anxiety decreased.\n\nThe studies, by researchers at New York University, with 29 patients, and at Johns Hopkins University, with 51, were released concurrently in The Journal of Psychopharmacology. They proceeded after arduous review by regulators and are the largest and most meticulous among a handful of trials to explore the possible therapeutic benefit of psilocybin.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Lieberman, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, and Dr. Daniel Shalev of the New York State Psychiatric Institute are among leaders in psychiatry, addiction medicine and palliative care who endorsed the work. The studies, they wrote, are \u201ca model for revisiting criminalized compounds of interest in a safe, ethical way.\u201d\n\nIf research restrictions could be eased, they continued, \u201cthere is much potential for new scientific insights and clinical applications.\u201d\n\nAlthough cancer patients will not have access to therapeutically administered psilocybin anytime soon, the findings add vigor to applications to expand research in a multicenter trial with hundreds of participants.\n\nSome medical professionals held the studies at arm\u2019s length. Dr. William Breitbart, chairman of the psychiatry department at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, questioned this use of cancer patients. \u201cMedical marijuana got its foot in the door by making the appeal that \u2018cancer patients are suffering, they\u2019re near death, so for compassionate purposes, let\u2019s make it available,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019re able to extend this drug to other purposes.\u201d\n\nPsilocybin trials are underway in the United States and Europe for alcoholism, tobacco addiction and treatment-resistant depression. Other hallucinogens are also being studied for clinical application. This week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a large-scale trial investigating MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy, for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nCancer-related psychological distress, which afflicts up to 40 percent of patients, can be resistant to conventional therapy. Mr. Mihai\u2019s anxiety began when doctors finally told him he was in remission.\n\nHe would keep touching the nodules on his neck, where the cancer had announced itself. He flew to Europe to celebrate the end of treatment and his graduation from college, but abruptly returned to New York, terrified to be away from oncologists. He began drinking daily, hard, jeopardizing his fragile health.\n\nAlarmed, doctors suggested the psilocybin study.\n\nHe took the capsule and began tripping. After seeing himself on a hospital stretcher, he recalled: \u201cI had an epiphany.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you letting yourself be terrorized by cancer coming back? This is dumb. It\u2019s in your power to get rid of the fear,\u201d he told himself. \u201cThat\u2019s when I saw black smoke rising from my body. And it felt great.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Mr. Mihai, now 25 and a physician assistant in Las Vegas, said, \u201cI\u2019m not anxious about cancer anymore. I\u2019m not anxious about dying.\u201d The session, he added, \u201chas made my life richer.\u201d\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, hallucinogens were studied in hundreds of trials. But by 1970, when those drugs were placed in the most restricted regulatory category, research ground to a near halt.\n\nSince about 2000, investigators have begun studying them, mostly with private funding. These two studies built on a 2011 UCLA psilocybin pilot project with 12 cancer patients.\n\nBoth share similarities. All volunteers had diagnoses of cancer-related anxiety or depression. Patients were randomly given a placebo or synthetic psilocybin, and not told which. Within seven weeks, they were given the other sample.\n\nAll patients were educated about the drug, monitored by two people throughout the placebo and psilocybin sessions, and seen for follow-up evaluation.\n\nResearchers created seven-hour music playlists, paced to the anticipated rhythms of the drug reaction. N.Y.U. leaned toward New Age and world music \u2014 Brian Eno; sitars; didgeridoos. Johns Hopkins favored Western classical.\n\nAt N.Y.U., psychotherapists tried to layer the session into patients\u2019 memories by asking them to write about their visions in a journal and discuss the experience in meetings. The Johns Hopkins study, led by Roland R. Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist, had monitors who urged participants to \u201ctrust, let go and be open.\u201d\n\nThe N.Y.U. researchers assessed patients the next day and found the effects to be immediate in most of them.\n\nDr. Stephen Ross, the lead investigator and chief of addiction psychiatry at N.Y.U., pointed out that antidepressants, by contrast, can take weeks to show benefit.\n\n\u201cCancer patients with anxiety and depression need help immediately,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially if you consider that they are at elevated risk for completed suicide.\u201d\n\nSome experts questioned the reliability of the results. Dr. Breitbart said that because diagnoses ranged from early-stage cancer to imminent terminal illness, it was impossible to know which patients might have come through their psychological ordeal without psilocybin \u2014 whether some might have adapted to the new norms of their disease; felt stronger once chemotherapy side effects, including depression, had abated; or even experienced an improvement in health.\n\nNone of those possibilities fit Kevin, who had a bone-marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukemia. It sent his cancer into remission, but left him with graft-versus-host disease.\n\nSuffering from chronic pain and fatigue, Kevin, 57, who lives in central Michigan and asked that his last name be withheld because he had been in law enforcement, had to retire. Four years after the transplant, he despaired.\n\n\u201cGoing through a near-death illness is similar to returning from combat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt damages who you are, to the core of what it is to be human.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hoping to get out of this funk of waiting for the other shoe to drop,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re looking up to the heavens, saying \u2018What else can I try?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn 2013, Kevin entered the Johns Hopkins trial. During his session, he saw spirals of iridescent spheres that folded in on themselves.\n\nThe experience did not restore him to his former life, he said, \u201cbut I have a greater sense of peace of what might come. I\u2019m very grateful, beyond words, for this trial. But you have to approach the session with the right intentions of why you\u2019re doing it. Because you\u2019re going to meet yourself. \u201d\n\nResearchers do not know why psilocybin has worked in these settings. Neuroimaging scans of healthy volunteers show areas of the brain lighting up or resting during dosing. Hallucinogens activate a serotonin receptor that can lead to the alterations of consciousness reported routinely.\n\nOne theory is that psilocybin interrupts the circuitry of self-absorbed thinking that is so pronounced in depressed people, making way for a mystical experience of selfless unity.\n\nThe studies received funding from the Heffter Research Institute, an alliance of scientists interested in the medical study of hallucinogens. Dr. George Greer, the co-founder of Heffter, does not see a commercial future for psilocybin, even if it is eventually approved for therapeutic use, because these patients needed only one dose.\n\nInstead, he envisions a nonprofit manufacturer, with distribution restricted to specialized clinics.\n\nResearchers were emphatic that these results should not be interpreted as condoning hallucinogenic mushrooms for self-treatment. Dr. Griffiths noted that patients received extensive support, which may have deepened and secured their life-affirming transformations.\n\n\u201cPeople will take psilocybin at a rave or at Burning Man\u201d \u2014 the art and performance desert festival \u2014 \u201cbut the effect,\u201d he said, \u201cevaporates like water running through their hands.\u201d\n", "move adds network streaming programming app nfl 6amonth cbs games boon popular": "\nCBS\u2019s stand-alone streaming app is adding the network\u2019s most valuable property: National Football League games.\n\nThe network announced Thursday that it struck a deal with the N.F.L. to stream football games broadcast by CBS, including during the playoffs. Games will be available for streaming beginning Sunday.\n\nFor CBS, this is a boon for its $6-a-month app. CBS debuted it two years ago, and streams shows like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d \u201cSurvivor,\u201d \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d and \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d In the coming months, CBS will introduce spinoffs of \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cBig Brother\u201d to the service, along with a new \u201cStar Trek\u201d series. But without the N.F.L., the streaming package lacked one of CBS\u2019s most popular assets.\n\nCBS said in July that the app has about a million subscribers; it also said earlier this year that it expected that number to increase to 4 million subscribers in the next five years.\n\nCBS All Access subscribers will be able to stream the game that is being broadcast by their local CBS affiliate, as well as playoff games and several of next year\u2019s Thursday night N.F.L. games.\n\n\u201cAdding the most-watched programming on television to the most-watched network on television will be a powerful combination as we continue to grow CBS All Access into the future,\u201d said Leslie Moonves, CBS\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThe N.F.L., which has seen steep ratings declines in prime-time games this season, has been toying with various digital experiments recently. Earlier this year, the league signed a deal with Twitter to live stream its Thursday Night Football games.\n\nThe deal also comes when many traditional TV networks are making greater efforts to stream their products. In October, CBS signed a deal to join a YouTube live-streaming service that is expected to debut next year and cost $25 to $40 a month. Last month, Hulu signed its part owners 21st Century Fox and Disney\u2019s cable networks to join a live streaming service that it also plans to roll out next year.\n", "fda party food trials approved administration treatment drug agrees ecstasy patients clinical relief illegal study ptsd largescale": "\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 After three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, C. J. Hardin wound up hiding from the world in a backwoods cabin in North Carolina. Divorced, alcoholic and at times suicidal, he had tried almost all the accepted treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder: psychotherapy, group therapy and nearly a dozen different medications.\n\n\u201cNothing worked for me, so I put aside the idea that I could get better,\u201d said Mr. Hardin, 37. \u201cI just pretty much became a hermit in my cabin and never went out.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2013, he joined a small drug trial testing whether PTSD could be treated with MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy.\n\n\u201cIt changed my life,\u201d he said in a recent interview in the bright, airy living room of the suburban ranch house here, where he now lives while going to college and working as an airplane mechanic. \u201cIt allowed me to see my trauma without fear or hesitation and finally process things and move forward.\u201d\n\nBased on promising results like Mr. Hardin\u2019s, the Food and Drug Administration gave permission Tuesday for large-scale, Phase 3 clinical trials of the drug \u2014 a final step before the possible approval of Ecstasy as a prescription drug.\n\nIf successful, the trials could turn an illicit street substance into a potent treatment for PTSD.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, the F.D.A. declined to comment, citing regulations that prohibit disclosing information about drugs that are being developed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautious but hopeful,\u201d said Dr. Charles R. Marmar, the head of psychiatry at New York University\u2019s Langone School of Medicine, a leading PTSD researcher who was not involved in the study. \u201cIf they can keep getting good results, it will be of great use. PTSD can be very hard to treat. Our best therapies right now don\u2019t help 30 to 40 percent of people. So we need more options.\u201d\n\nBut he expressed concern about the potential for abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s a feel-good drug, and we know people are prone to abuse it,\u201d he said. \u201cProlonged use can lead to serious damage to the brain.\u201d\n\nThe Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a small nonprofit created in 1985 to advocate the legal medical use of MDMA, LSD, marijuana and other banned drugs, sponsored six Phase 2 studies treating a total of 130 PTSD patients with the stimulant. It will also fund the Phase 3 research, which will include at least 230 patients.\n\nTwo trials here in Charleston focused on treating combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and police and firefighters with PTSD who had not responded to traditional prescription drugs or psychotherapy. Patients had, on average, struggled with symptoms for 17 years.\n\nAfter three doses of MDMA administered under a psychiatrist\u2019s guidance, the patients reported a 56 percent decrease of severity of symptoms on average, one study found. By the end of the study, two-thirds no longer met the criteria for having PTSD. Follow-up examinations found that improvements lasted more than a year after therapy.\n\n\u201cWe can sometimes see this kind of remarkable improvement in traditional psychotherapy, but it can take years, if it happens at all,\u201d said Dr. Michael C. Mithoefer, the psychiatrist who conducted the trials here. \u201cWe think it works as a catalyst that speeds the natural healing process.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are so optimistic that they have applied for so-called breakthrough therapy status with the Food and Drug Administration, which would speed the approval process. If approved, the drug could be available by 2021.\n\nUnder the researchers\u2019 proposal for approval, the drug would be used a limited number of times in the presence of trained psychotherapists as part of a broader course of therapy. But even in those controlled circumstances, some scientists worry that approval as a therapy could encourage more illegal recreational use.\n\n\u201cIt sends the message that this drug will help you solve your problems, when often it just creates problems,\u201d said Andrew Parrott, a psychologist at Swansea University in Wales who has studied the brains of chronic Ecstasy users. \u201cThis is a messy drug we know can do damage.\u201d\n\nAllowing doctors to administer the drug to treat a disorder, he warned, could inadvertently lead to a wave of abuse similar to the current opioid crisis.\n\nDuring initial studies, patients went through 12 weeks of psychotherapy, including three eight-hour sessions in which they took MDMA. During the sessions, they lay on a futon amid candles and fresh flowers, listening to soothing music.\n\nDr. Mithoefer and his wife, Ann Mithoefer, and often their portly terrier mix, Flynn, sat with each patient, guiding them through traumatic memories.\n\n\u201cThe medicine allows them to look at things from a different place and reclassify them,\u201d said Ms. Mithoefer, a psychiatric nurse. \u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t have to do much. Each person has an innate ability to heal. We just create the right conditions.\u201d\n\nResearch has shown that the drug causes the brain to release a flood of hormones and neurotransmitters that evoke feelings of trust, love and well-being, while also muting fear and negative emotional memories that can be overpowering in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients say the drug gave them heightened clarity and ability to address their problems.\n\nFor years after his combat deployments, Mr. Hardin said he was sleepless and on edge. His dreams were marked with explosions and death. The Army gave him sleeping pills and antidepressants. When they didn\u2019t work, he turned to alcohol and began withdrawing from the world.\n\n\u201cI just felt hopeless and in the dark,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the MDMA sessions showed me a light I could move toward. Now I\u2019m out of the darkness and the world is all around me.\u201d\n\nSince the trial, he has gone back to school and remarried.\n\nThe chemist Alexander Shulgin first realized the euphoria-inducing traits of MDMA in the 1970s, and introduced it to psychologists he knew. Under the nickname Adam, thousands of psychologists began to use it as an aid for therapy sessions. Some researchers at the time thought the drug could be helpful for anxiety disorders, including PTSD, but before formal clinical trails could start, Adam spread to dance clubs and college campuses under the name Ecstasy, and in 1985, the Drug Enforcement Administration made it a Schedule 1 drug, barring all legal use.\n\nSince then, the number of people seeking treatment for PTSD has exploded and psychiatry has struggled to keep pace. Two drugs approved for treating the disorder worked only mildly better than placebos in trials. Current psychotherapy approaches are often slow and many patients drop out when they don\u2019t see results. Studies have shown combat veterans are particularly hard to treat.\n\nIn interviews, study participants said MDMA therapy had not only helped them with painful memories, but also had helped them stop abusing alcohol and other drugs and put their lives back together.\n\nOn a recent evening, Edward Thompson, a former firefighter, tucked his twin 4-year-old girls into bed, turned on their night light, then joined his wife at a backyard fire.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for MDMA \u2026 \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d be dead,\u201d his wife, Laura, finished.\n\nThey both nodded.\n\nYears of responding to gory accidents left Mr. Thompson, 30, in a near constant state of panic that he had tried to numb with alcohol and prescription opiates and benzodiazepines.\n\nBy 2015, efforts at therapy had failed, and so had several family interventions. His wife had left with their children, and he was considering jumping in front of a bus.\n\nA member of a conservative Anglican church, Mr. Thompson had never used illegal drugs. But he was struggling with addiction from his prescription drugs, so he at first rejected a suggestion by his therapist that he enter the study. \u201cIn the end, I was out of choices,\u201d he said.\n\nThree sessions with the drug gave him the clarity, he said, to identify his problems and begin to work through them. He does not wish to take the drug again.\n\n\u201cIt gave me my life back, but it wasn\u2019t a party drug,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a lot of work.\u201d\n", "imagining raised hero finishes success completing expectations tiger start fans woods unqualified challenge world rounds play": "\nNASSAU, the Bahamas \u2014 Tiger Woods raised his putter in celebration, so sure was he that his 40-foot birdie effort would be swallowed by the cup on the third hole of his final round of the Hero World Challenge.

Before the event, when the prevailing question was whether Woods\u2019s balky back would allow him to finish four rounds, that result would have been seen as an unqualified success.\n\nBut by Sunday, the 40-year-old Woods had raised expectations significantly, coming away with birdies on 19 holes across the first three rounds \u2014 Matsuyama had a birdie or better on only three more holes in the same span \u2014 and briefly getting to 11 under par in his third round. As Woods warmed up for his final 18, some of the fans who had come to witness his return engaged in their own premature celebrations, giddily wondering out loud how often he might win in 2017.\n\nOver the final 18 holes, a persistent wind whipped the facade off Woods\u2019s game. He struggled off the tee, with his irons and around the greens. Anyone in need of a reality check had only to watch Woods play the par-5, 595-yard sixth hole. After his first two shots, Woods was short of the green. He bladed his next shot, chunked his fourth, chipped to 6 feet and missed the putt, carding a 7.\n\nWoods made double bogeys on two par 5s on Sunday and was worse than par on two of the five par 5s for the week.\n\n\u201cI played the par 5s, quite frankly, awful,\u201d Woods said, adding: \u201cI felt like I did some really positive things. I\u2019m pleased about that. I just need to clean it up.\u201d\n\nThe Albany Golf Club course, with its tightly mowed areas around the greens, provided a gentle test for Woods, who has struggled with his short game the past two years. The main takeaway from Woods\u2019s return to golf after a 466-day absence was that his good shots were very good and his misses horrid.\n\nThe bad shots were to be expected after so much time away from competition. Woods\u2019s strength has always been his mind, and he showed on Sunday that he could still will his way around a course by reeling off three consecutive birdies after the double bogey at No. 6.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been phenomenal to watch him this week,\u201d the NBC golf analyst David Feherty said. \u201cIt\u2019s too good to be true. The whole world has been holding its breath.\u201d\n\nThe golf world can exhale now.\n\n\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Woods\u2019s caddie, Joe LaCava, said, \u201cbut he looks good walking, he looks good over the ball, and he looks good when he\u2019s done playing, so those are all positives.\u201d\n\nStill, Woods has much work left to do if he wants to challenge millennials like the 24-year-old Matsuyama, who closed with a 73. He is 89 under in his last 24 rounds and has won four of his last five starts.\n\nJordan Spieth, 23, who won the Hero World Challenge in 2014 and finished tied for sixth this year, suggested that Woods\u2019s next step forward would be playing in back-to-back weeks, which he did just twice in the 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons.\n\nAt the 2014 Hero World Challenge, held in Florida, Spieth finished 26 strokes ahead of Woods, who tied for 17th in the 18-player field. Woods, then returning from a four-month layoff to rest his back, said, \u201cThe good sign is that I played four straight days, was in no pain, and I was able to hit the golf ball as hard as I wanted to.\u201d\n\nNine months after that positive assessment, Woods had back surgery, precipitating the longest layoff of his 21-year pro career. So when Woods said Sunday that he felt good, free of pain, it could not be taken as absolute reassurance.\n\nThe plan now, Woods said, is to play a full schedule, which for him would be 15 to 20 events, in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be smart about it,\u201d Woods said.\n\nHis next competitive start \u2014 and his first in a full-field event with a cut since August 2015 \u2014 should come next month, in the United Arab Emirates or at the PGA Tour stop in San Diego.\n\nHenrik Stenson won this year\u2019s British Open three months after his 40th birthday, and Jim Furyk, 46, carded a 58 in August, so Woods is by no means too old or decrepit to add to his 79 PGA Tour victories.\n\nBut winning nine times in a season, as he did in 2000, when he was Matsuyama\u2019s age, or even five times, as Woods did in 2013, seems unimaginable for him now.\n\n\u201cI think it would be hard, where golf is at right now, to be as dominant as Tiger was,\u201d Stenson said, \u201ceven if Tiger were to play as good as he did in 2000.\u201d\n\nWoods got through this weekend, which is a step in the right direction. \u201cBig picture?\u201d Woods said with a smile. \u201cIt feels good to be back out here playing again and competing and trying to beat the best players in the world.\u201d\n", "frazzled profit science price peace headspace hand meditation offers palm audience conflict finding app company worry techniques": "\nOn a recent Sunday, football fans viewing the showdown between the Los Angeles Rams and the New York Jets saw an unusual ad among the spots for pickup trucks and light beer. Against a backdrop of pastel colors and an up-tempo beat, a diverse cast of athletes testified:\n\n\u201cI meditate to crush it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meditate to not freak out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meditate to have the edge.\u201d\n\nThe ad was for Headspace, a guided meditation app developed by two Britons \u2014 a former monk and an advertising executive. By targeting the vast audience of football fans, the Headspace team was making clear its belief that meditation is something with mass commercial appeal.\n\nTheir pitch has new resonance on the heels of a bitter election. In the week after Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential race, Headspace said it had experienced a 44 percent jump in its app\u2019s \u201cSOS\u201d meditation, a sort of panic button for the frazzled. Yet even without an anxious electorate, Headspace was finding an audience.\n\nA standout among a group of websites, apps and consulting firms that are seeking to capitalize on the current craze for all things mindful, the Headspace app has been downloaded more than 11 million times.\n\nWith its coffers full from a recent funding round befitting a Silicon Valley social media darling, Headspace is now aiming to convert millions more people with advertisements on network television and posters plastered on New York City bus stops and subway stations.\n\nYet even as Headspace finds its groove, questions linger about just how broad its appeal can be, and whether the app\u2019s creators can back up their aspirational claims with real science.\n\n\u201cThe cheerleading phase is over,\u201d said James Gimian, publisher of Mindful magazine. \u201cPeople know mindfulness can be a good thing. Now people need to do research into what the benefits are in specific applications.\u201d\n\nHeadspace was founded by Rich Pierson and his buddy Andy Puddicombe in 2010. At the time, Mr. Pierson was a stressed-out ad executive in London, and Mr. Puddicombe \u2014 who had studied as a Buddhist monk and dabbled as a circus performer \u2014 was teaching meditation to anxious Britons.\n\nThe two men agreed to barter: Mr. Puddicombe would teach Mr. Pierson how to meditate in exchange for help in developing something with mass market potential.\n\nBy 2012, they had their first app. Mr. Puddicombe, with his chummy British accent, honed and narrated the teachings, which were delivered through a mix of cartoons, videos of Mr. Puddicombe and podcasts. And the app gained decent traction, for a meditation app at least.\n\nBut in 2013, the pair moved the company from London to Los Angeles. England, Mr. Pierson said, is \u201cone of the most cynical markets in the world,\u201d and the co-founders were optimists. Also, they wanted to surf.\n\nIn 2014 they updated the app. Before that relaunch, they had fewer than one million downloads. Since then, growth has taken off. Last year Headspace raised $30 million in a financing round led by the Chernin Group and rounded out by celebrities including Jared Leto and Jessica Alba.\n\nToday, Headspace claims to employ 160 people at offices in Los Angeles, London and San Francisco. The company doesn\u2019t disclose revenue.\n\nWhat Headspace is selling is deceptively simple. By instructing people to focus on their breathing and let go of thoughts and emotions, Mr. Puddicombe gently coaxes users back to fuller engagement with the present moment. In modern parlance, it is mindfulness \u2014 a quick, secularized adaptation of Buddhist teachings that have been distilled for a modern, Western audience. A 10-day course on the app is free. Annual subscriptions cost about $100.\n\nFor this price, the goal is not so much enlightenment as it is stress relief and self-care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great if people think it can help them with sleep and productivity and the rest, but really what we\u2019re trying to do is get them to be more compassionate,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t that be an amazing skill for the world to learn at the moment?\u201d\n\nOf course, compassion wasn\u2019t what Headspace was pitching in the commercials that aired during the football game. And therein lies one of the inherent tensions with a for-profit meditation company: In the rush to expand a business, it\u2019s easy to misrepresent, oversell or exaggerate the benefits of a product, especially something as mercurial as mindfulness.\n\nIn particular, some claim that Headspace has gone too far in trying to appeal to those in fragile emotional states by offering meditation courses devised to treat depression.\n\n\u201cThe problem I have with Headspace is the way they\u2019ve expanded their content to target vulnerable populations,\u201d said Zindel Segal, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, and the co-developer of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, a meditation-based treatment for depression.\n\n\u201cThey have no research that validates the claims they are making in this area,\u201d Professor Segal said, \u201cyet their business model requires that they constantly grow their user base.\u201d\n\nHeadspace says it is sensitive to these concerns.\n\n\u201cScience is one of those things we take really seriously,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. Headspace has dozens of studies going on, employs many scientists who are building on the already voluminous body of research documenting meditation\u2019s potential benefits, and says it will publish more research soon.\n\nMr. Pierson also noted that Headspace tells users to seek professional help if they have severe depression and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t meant to replace medication.\u201d\n\nYet in the end, Mr. Pierson was somewhat defiant.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to put stuff out there that will help people,\u201d he said. If meditation and mindfulness can cheer someone up, is a peer-reviewed study really necessary?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Western science has a monopoly on the human condition.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to another growing market opportunity \u2014 the business of selling meditation offerings to corporations \u2014 Headspace has exhibited restraint. There is no special version of the app for enterprise customers, and Headspace says less than half of a percent of all subscriptions are paid for by companies as a benefit to employees.\n\n\u201cI worry about people getting it from H.R.,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cIf companies are going to promote it, I want them to do it not just because of productivity, but because they want their teams to be healthier and happier.\u201d\n\nHeadspace has an early lead, but the field is becoming more crowded. Thrive Global, a venture from Arianna Huffington, will be introduced soon. Audible, the audiobooks company owned by Amazon.com, is expanding its mindfulness offerings. And rival apps including Calm, Insight Timer and 10% Happier are all vying for mind share.\n\nIn the meantime, Headspace will hope to capitalize on the nation\u2019s lingering unease.\n\n\u201cMeditation helps you be more comfortable with the uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Pierson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a bump in usage postelection.\u201d\n", "case definition supreme death court inmates lean sparing disability life intellectual penalty involving hear legal justices problems texas": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared skeptical of the way Texas decides who must be spared the death penalty on account of intellectual disability, with several justices indicating that the state\u2019s standards were either too strict or too arbitrary.\n\nBut there was also disagreement and confusion over precisely what the state\u2019s standards required. A lawyer for Bobby J. Moore, a death row inmate challenging his death sentence, said the state used outdated medical standards and looked to factors rooted in stereotypes.\n\nScott A. Keller, the Texas solicitor general, said judges there followed the requirements of a 2002 Supreme Court decision, Atkins v. Virginia. That ruling barred the execution of the intellectually disabled but largely left it to individual states to fashion their own standards in deciding who qualifies.\n\nIt was not Texas\u2019 goal, Mr. Keller said, \u201cto screen out individuals and deny them relief.\u201d\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who often votes with the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing to limit the death penalty, was skeptical. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that the effect?\u201d he asked.\n\nMr. Moore has been on death row since 1980 for fatally shooting a 72-year-old Houston supermarket clerk, James McCarble, during a robbery.\n\nClifford M. Sloan, a lawyer for Mr. Moore, said there was no doubt that his client suffered from intellectual deficits. \u201cIt\u2019s undisputed, for example,\u201d Mr. Sloan said, \u201cthat at the age of 13, Mr. Moore did not understand the days of the week, the months of the year, the seasons, how to tell time, the principle that subtraction is the opposite of addition or standard units of measurement.\u201d\n\nThe state judge who heard this and other evidence, relying on current medical standards on intellectual disability, concluded that executing Mr. Moore would violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nBut the Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas\u2019 highest court for criminal matters, reversed that ruling, saying the judge had made a mistake in \u201cemploying the definition of intellectual disability presently used.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 approach, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, was partly grounded in factors drawn from the fictional character of Lennie Small, the dim, hulking farmhand in John Steinbeck\u2019s novella \u201cOf Mice and Men.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, in the decision that set out the standards Texas uses, Judge Cathy Cochran of the Court of Criminal Appeals wrote that Lennie should be a legal touchstone. \u201cMost Texas citizens might agree that Steinbeck\u2019s Lennie should, by virtue of his lack of reasoning ability and adaptive skills, be exempt\u201d from the death penalty, she wrote.\n\nJustice Sotomayor said Mr. Moore was at least as intellectually disabled as Lennie. \u201cThe state had no problem in saying that Lennie, even though he could work, earn a living, plan his trying to hide the death of the rabbit he killed, that he could do all of those things, and yet he was not just mildly, but severely disabled,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Moore, by contrast, she said, \u201cwas eating out of garbage cans repeatedly and getting sick after each time he did it, but not learning from his mistakes.\u201d His few talents, she said, did not alter the analysis.\n\n\u201cWhy is the fact that he could mow lawns and play pool indicative of a strength that overcomes all the other deficits?\u201d she asked.\n\nMr. Keller, the state\u2019s lawyer, said that the passage in Judge Cochran\u2019s opinion concerning Lennie was an aside with no legal force.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said there will always be borderline cases and a degree of arbitrariness in deciding who is disabled intellectually. He said he was worried that every such dispute would end up at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWhat is the court supposed to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre we supposed to have all those hearings here?\u201d\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. questioned whether the Supreme Court was obliged to follow the view of medical societies in deciding who must be spared execution. Constitutional law, he said, was different from standards adopted by a majority vote of a professional organization.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday also issued its first decision in an argued case this term, ruling that a Puerto Rican politician and a business executive there must face a second trial on bribery charges. The case, Bravo-Fernandez v. United States, No. 15-537, arose from a trip to Las Vegas by the politician, H\u00e9ctor Mart\u00ednez-Maldonado, partly paid for by the executive, Juan Bravo-Fernandez.\n\nA jury convicted the two men of bribery, but acquitted them of related charges that they had traveled or conspired to commit bribery. The verdicts are impossible to reconcile, both sides agreed, as the only contested issue on any of the charges was whether there had been bribery.\n\nA federal appeals court later vacated the remaining convictions, saying that the judge had given jurors too much leeway by allowing them to convict if they found the executive had made the payments in gratitude rather than, as the law required, as part of a quid quo pro exchange.\n\nThe men had contended that the second trial violated the Constitution\u2019s double jeopardy clause.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg announced the court\u2019s unanimous decision from the bench. Apparently suffering from a bad cold, she spoke in a halting, raspy voice, saying the case\u2019s tangled procedural history \u201cdoes not bar retrial of the defendants.\u201d\n", "selection playoffs ten washington college committee title chosen state won passed semifinalists penn football beat big buckeyes meet clemson october footballs ohio alabama dec": "\nThe College Football Playoff\u2019s selection committee on Sunday announced the four teams that will contend for this season\u2019s national championship: Alabama (13-0), followed by Clemson (12-1), Ohio State (11-1) and Washington (12-1).\n\nThe Crimson Tide \u2014 who earned a sort of home-field advantage as the playoff\u2019s top seed, drawing a berth in the semifinal game closer to their campus \u2014 will meet the fourth-seeded Huskies in the Peach Bowl in Atlanta the afternoon of Dec. 31. Clemson, the second seed, will face Ohio State, the third, in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz., that evening.\n\nThe semifinal winners will meet Jan. 9 in Tampa, Fla., to decide the national title.\n\nThe first team outside the top four was Penn State (11-2), which defeated Wisconsin, 38-31, on Saturday night for the Big Ten championship. Another Big Ten team, Michigan (10-2), came next in the rankings.\n\nOn ESPN, Kirby Hocutt, the committee\u2019s chairman, explained the selection of Washington over Penn State by citing the Nittany Lions\u2019 two losses; although they were early in the season, one defeat came against a team that finished the regular season with four losses (Pittsburgh), and one came in a 49-10 blowout against Michigan. Hocutt also pointed out that Washington\u2019s sole loss came against highly regarded Southern California (No. 9 in Sunday\u2019s rankings) and that it beat ranked teams in Stanford, Utah and Colorado (No. 10).\n\nStill, while Washington proved Penn State\u2019s most immediate competitor for the final playoff spot, the Nittany Lions\u2019 most resonant comparison is with their conference mate Ohio State. Because of a 24-21 loss at Penn State in October, the Buckeyes did not even reach the Big Ten championship game.\n\nA conference championship is listed as a factor in the committee\u2019s deliberations, and across the playoff format\u2019s three seasons, this year\u2019s Buckeyes are the only one of the 12 selected squads without a conference title.\n\nA similar situation happened only a couple of times in the 16 years of the old Bowl Championship Series system, most recently when Louisiana State and Alabama, both of the Southeastern Conference, played in the national title game in January 2012.\n\nTom Osborne, the former Nebraska coach who sat on the selection committee in its first two years, explained in an interview last week that the listed factors \u2014 which also include strength of schedule and head-to-head matchups \u2014 are not boxes that must be checked but rather tools used for the larger goal of determining the strongest teams.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you\u2019re looking for is the four best teams,\u201d Osborne said, adding, \u201cOnce you get down to teams that are very close and you\u2019re looking for some determining, discriminating factor, certainly conference championship can be used to pick one team over another.\u201d\n\nWashington played much weaker nonconference teams than the excluded Penn State, but Hocutt, who is also Texas Tech\u2019s athletic director, emphasized that Ohio State\u2019s road victory in September against Oklahoma \u2014 No. 7 in Sunday\u2019s playoff rankings \u2014 showed that the committee did care about teams\u2019 schedules.\n\nAlabama is the only team that has reached the playoff in all three years of the four-team format. The Crimson Tide also played in three of the last five title games under the B.C.S. system, meaning that, under Coach Nick Saban, the team has been in contention for the national championship after the regular season in six of the last eight years. A title in January would be Alabama\u2019s fifth in eight years \u2014 an unprecedented dynasty in top-tier college football.\n\nWashington is a much less likely contender. The program\u2019s last claimed national title came in the 1991 season, and it finished the 2008 season 0-12. But under Coach Chris Petersen, in his third season after a fruitful tenure with Boise State, the Huskies went 8-1 in the deep Pacific-12 Conference before routing Colorado, 41-10, on Friday night in the league\u2019s championship game.\n\nThe two other semifinalists have experience in the young playoff system.\n\nIn the 2014 season, which introduced the playoff, Ohio State made the field as the fourth seed, upset Alabama in a semifinal and then defeated Oregon for the championship. Last season, Clemson, as the top seed, beat Oklahoma in a semifinal before falling, 45-40, to Alabama.\n\nFor the second time in three seasons, the only so-called Power 5 conference without a playoff representative is the Big 12, whose champion this season was Oklahoma (10-2).\n\nNext season, the Big 12 will join the other major conferences in holding a championship game. Still, having decided this year not to expand, it will stay the smallest major conference, with 10 teams. That could keep it, as the University of Oklahoma\u2019s president, David L. Boren,  put it last year, \u201cpsychologically disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nWestern Michigan (13-0), of the Mid-American Conference, was the committee\u2019s highest-ranked team from outside the Power 5, at No. 15. The only undefeated Football Bowl Subdivision team beyond Alabama, the Broncos earned a spot in the Cotton Bowl, set for Jan. 2, against Wisconsin (10-3), which was ranked eighth by the committee.\n", "bearing explosion plans rocket launch federal hinges months administration spacexs satellites investigation reviewing aviation spacex approval sept launchpad": "\nThree months after one of its rockets exploded on a launchpad, SpaceX hopes to resume launching in a couple of weeks.\n\nIridium Communications, which provides communications services through a constellation of more than 60 satellites, announced Thursday that it was aiming to launch the first batch of its next-generation satellites on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Dec. 16.\n\nThe launch hinges on approval by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is reviewing SpaceX\u2019s investigation of the Sept. 1 launchpad explosion. A Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Fla., caught fire and exploded during fueling before a test firing of its engines. The explosion destroyed a $200 million Israeli satellite that Facebook had planned to use to expand internet services in Africa and elsewhere.\n\nBut Matthew J. Desch, chief executive of Iridium, said his company had taken part in the SpaceX investigation, adding that he had read a preliminary explanation for the accident. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t approve our satellites to be launched if I wasn\u2019t confident,\u201d Mr. Desch said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to return to flight with the first Iridium NEXT launch,\u201d Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement, referring to Iridium\u2019s satellite constellation.\n\nThe F.A.A. said that the investigation was still underway and that it had not yet approved the launch.\n\nSpaceX officials did not provide any new technical details of what went wrong in September.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC in November, Elon Musk, SpaceX\u2019s chief executive, said the company had identified the cause. Liquid oxygen flowing into a second-stage tank had frozen solid, setting off a catastrophic sequence of events, he said. In that same interview, Mr. Musk said he hoped to resume flights in mid-December.\n\nThe explosion damaged SpaceX\u2019s launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 Iridium satellites will instead lift off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the site of a second SpaceX launchpad.\n\nIridium provides communication services including satellite telephones through its network of satellites circling the Earth at an altitude of 485 miles. The original satellites launched two decades ago at a cost of $5 billion, but Iridium flopped, declaring bankruptcy in 1999. The company finally found its financial footing.\n\nSixty-five of the original satellites are still in orbit, and Iridium is planning to replace all of them in the next year and a half, with seven Falcon 9 launches carrying 70 satellites, each roughly the size of a Mini Cooper. The new satellites are bigger and more powerful, able to send data at faster rates. Iridium is also planning new services like the tracking of planes and ships in real time.\n\n\u201cThis will know where every airplane is, second by second,\u201d Mr. Desch said. That could prevent another disaster like the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished in March 2014. More important, Mr. Desch said, that kind of real-time global information would allow the assignment of more efficient flight paths for airliners while still making sure they stay safely apart.\n\nFor launches from Florida, SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. It is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station in January.\n", "star trump campaign rights critics media visible young vocal ire tomi donald rising ms racist lahren drawn commentaries supporter presidential": "\n\u201cI\u2019m in the lion\u2019s den, Trevor.\u201d\n\nTomi Lahren, a 24-year-old conservative commentator, had left her bubble of more than 4.3 million followers on social media last week to appear in front of the progressive, diverse audience that attends the weeknight tapings of \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u201d in Manhattan.\n\nBefore the interview began, Mr. Noah requested that the studio audience be polite to Ms. Lahren. \u201cImagine you\u2019re at Thanksgiving again, and your racist uncle walked in,\u201d he joked.\n\nMs. Lahren hosts a nightly show, \u201cTomi,\u201d for The Blaze, a website, TV station and subscription service created by the conservative media personality Glenn Beck. And her reputation \u2014 among supporters, detractors and her prodigious online following \u2014 has been built on the commentaries with which she closes each show.\n\nA segment from August featuring an incendiary address to the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been watched on Facebook 66 million times. Ms. Lahren criticized Mr. Kaepernick, who had been protesting racial oppression by kneeling during the national anthem before games, pointing at unemployment and homicide rates, and saying that black people should take responsibility for their communities being run \u201cinto the ground.\u201d Ms. Lahren has also been critical of prominent black people like President Obama and Beyonc\u00e9 in commentaries that have gone viral.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, she became one of the most visible young supporters of President-elect Donald J. Trump, saying that she was using her show to speak for those who live between the coasts and \u201care too timid or too bashful or too busy to voice their own opinion.\u201d It is an approach that has made her a new media star, while also drawing the ire of critics who say her commentaries are often racist.\n\nBrendesha Tynes, a professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in addressing social media issues and cyberbullying, initially declined to comment on Ms. Lahren\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d appearance, saying, \u201cWe normalize racism when we give these folks a platform.\u201d She later elaborated, saying Ms. Lahren\u2019s appearance \u201csends a signal to our children and the world that facts don\u2019t matter, that hate is normal.\u201d\n\nIt is likely that Ms. Lahren\u2019s audience has little crossover with Mr. Noah\u2019s. Ms. Lahren, whose name is pronounced \u201cTommy,\u201d seemed unfazed during her half-hour conversation on politics and race with Mr. Noah, even as the audience booed and laughed at her.\n\n\u201cThere were some people in the audience that were just there to razz me,\u201d she said afterward, adding that she did not think she persuaded anyone in attendance with her arguments. At one point, she compared the Black Lives Matter movement to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe next day, however, footage from the interview was popular online, prompting headlines like \u201cTrevor Noah Expertly Skewers Conservative Tomi Lahren\u201d from The Huffington Post, and \u201cTrevor Noah Thoughtfully Confronting Tomi Lahren on Racism on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 Might Be His Best Work Ever\u201d from New York magazine.\n\nThere was speculation that Ms. Lahren and Mr. Noah could develop a friendly sparring relationship not unlike that of Bill O\u2019Reilly and Jon Stewart. Many conservative outlets praised Ms. Lahren\u2019s appearance. A headline on RedFlagNews.com read \u201cTomi Lahren Enters the Lion\u2019s Den, Takes On Trevor Noah on His Own Show.\u201d\n\nDavid Dennis Jr., a journalism professor at Morehouse College, was disappointed by reactions to the interview.\n\n\u201cPeople talked about it as if they were exchanging ideas and talking about beliefs \u2014 like they were debating sports,\u201d he said, asserting that Ms. Lahren\u2019s words \u201care literally life-threatening to black people.\u201d\n\nWhen she said, for instance, that the Black Lives Matter movement aimed to murder police officers, \u201cpeople hear that and they believe that, and they see me as a threat,\u201d Mr. Dennis said, citing the death of Trayvon Martin.\n\nMs. Lahren has frequently denied being racist. In interviews with The New York Times last week, she condemned the fringe movement known as the alt-right, which espouses white nationalism and anti-Semitism, calling it \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and said she would never be \u201can advocate, a cheerleader or an apologist for the K.K.K. or any other hate group.\u201d\n\nMs. Lahren, an only child born and raised in South Dakota by parents from ranching backgrounds, studied broadcast journalism and political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, graduating in 2014. She started working at The Blaze in October 2015, after piquing the network\u2019s interest with a viral video criticizing President Obama.\n\nIn the interviews, Ms. Lahren spoke about issues that inspire her. There are numerous military veterans in her family, she said, including a grandfather who was a paratrooper in World War II and an uncle who was awarded the Purple Heart during Vietnam. Ms. Lahren, who recently dated a Navy SEAL, spoke passionately about the hardships of being a soldier and of being related to one.\n\nShe does not call herself spiritual \u2014 \u201cSpiritual sounds like you worship the grass,\u201d she joked \u2014 but said she believes in God and prays every night and when she runs, often asking \u201cto be a better person.\u201d But she also blasted organized religion as being \u201cabout hierarchy, power, control and greed.\u201d Minutes later, she said, \u201cThe institution of religion is important.\u201d She is pro-choice and does not object to gay marriage.\n\nShe curses regularly, and professes to love junk food and the rappers Pusha T and Kendrick Lamar. She enjoys argument as sport and, as evidenced by her appearance with Mr. Noah, can be a talented sparring partner.\n\nShe testified to her authenticity \u2014 \u201cPeople like me because I\u2019m real\u201d \u2014 but said of Mr. Noah and herself, \u201cWe both know that we have to play these parts.\u201d She mocks liberal \u201csnowflakes\u201d as being overly sensitive to name-calling, but says she is bothered when people use the word \u201cretard.\u201d\n\nMs. Lahren says she is surprised when she meets black fans. Charlamagne Tha God, the host of the New York-based radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d is friendly with her. He does not think Ms. Lahren is racist, but \u201cmisinformed,\u201d he said in a phone interview. He enjoys her show, he said, identifying with Ms. Lahren\u2019s \u201cpolitical incorrectness.\u201d He stressed the importance of Democrats speaking directly to people like her.\n\nStill, he said, \u201cI have to remind myself that some of the rhetoric she puts out there is troubling.\u201d\n\nHe said that in a recent conversation with Ms. Lahren, he questioned what he saw as her contradictory views. For instance, when he asked why she supported Mr. Trump, given the bigotry of some of his supporters, she said that a few bad apples did not represent the movement.\n\n\u201cSo you have to have that same respect with the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d Charlamagne recalled telling her.\n\nMs. Lahren said she was an informal adviser to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign on its use of social media starting in August, and she appeared on the campaign\u2019s behalf via Facebook Live broadcasts in the final weeks before the election. She has about 3.5 million followers on Facebook and over 800,000 cumulatively on Twitter and Instagram. She is open to opportunities beyond The Blaze, including any that might involve Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhile Ms. Lahren, a fan of the radio host Howard Stern and the rapper Eminem, often seems to enjoy causing controversy, at other times she is more conciliatory. She expressed hope that \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d would show an unfamiliar side.\n\n\u201cI find that when people are actually around me, it\u2019s impossible not to like me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople expect me to be angry, bitter. They expect to me be abrasive, aggressive. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n", "younger increased people older years past stroke rising rates declining": "\nStroke rates have been declining in older people over the past 20 years \u2014 but have sharply increased in those under 55.\n\nResearchers at Rutgers University used data from the New Jersey Department of Health on more than 227,000 hospitalizations for stroke from 1995 through 2014, calculating incidence by age over five-year periods. The findings appeared in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nCompared with the 1995-99 period, the rate of stroke in 2010-14 increased by 147 percent in people 35 to 39, by 101 percent in people 40 to 44, by 68 percent in those 45 to 49, and by 23 percent in the 50 to 54 group.\n\nStroke is still far more common in older people. But the rate decreased by 11 percent in those 55 to 59, by 22 percent in the 60 to 64 group, and by 18 percent in people 65 to 69.\n\nThe reasons are unclear, but the lead author, Joel N. Swerdel, now an epidemiologist with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said that increasing obesity and diabetes in younger people are probably involved.\n\n\u201cFor a person 30 to 50, the good news is you ain\u2019t dead yet,\u201d he said. \u201cWith behavioral changes, changing diet, increasing exercise, there\u2019s still hope for you. Behavioral change is hard, but this study is an early warning sign.\u201d\n", "maneuvers begin death series studied rings graze years spacecraft planets cassini date saturn commence dozen": "\nIt\u2019s the beginning of a spectacular, almost circuslike end for NASA\u2019s Cassini mission. For 12 years Cassini has been buzzing about Saturn, its rings and its moons. As a result we know that there are methane lakes on Titan and jets of water shooting from Enceladus, and the rings themselves have warps, ripples, hills twists and braids.\n\nNow the Cassini spacecraft has gradually shifted into an orbit that takes it over the planet\u2019s north and south poles and then down into a series of increasingly vertiginous-looking dives perpendicular to the plane of its buttery glowing rings.\n\nStarting on Wednesday, as shown here, with a gravitational nudge from the moon Titan, Cassini is set to commence a series of 20 dives just outside the outer edge of the main ring system. Along the way the spacecraft will try to sample ring particles and gases that live there in its vicinity, and pass only 56,000 miles above Saturn\u2019s cloud tops.\n\nIn April, Cassini will shift its orbit again to slice between the planet and the rings, sneaking as close as 1,012 miles from the clouds of Saturn in 22 more orbits. Finally, on Sept. 15, at 8:07 a.m., Earth time in New York, the spacecraft will crash into the clouds of Saturn and burn up.\n\nScience will never be the same. Nor will Saturn, now forever polluted by a few stray atoms from the blue planet. Thereafter, there will always be a little piece of Earth on Saturn.\n", "information colleges privacy freespeech womans students highlights professor seeking kentucky fight administrators reported paper allegation suit press pits campus concerned": "\nThe confidential informant had an explosive tip for the University of Kentucky\u2019s campus newspaper: An associate professor of entomology had been accused of groping students, and the college, after an investigation, had permitted him to leave quietly.\n\nOn the trail of a hot story, the paper, The Kentucky Kernel, requested files from the university. Officials turned over some documents, but they contained few details.\n\nMonths later, though, in August, a 122-page dossier about the accusations was leaked to the newspaper, which reported the specifics, including one woman\u2019s claim that the professor had grabbed her buttocks, crotch and breast during an off-campus conference in 2013.\n\nNow The Kernel is being sued by the university in a continuing battle over whether records in the case should be disclosed. And it is just one of several disputes between universities and student newspapers, which are pushing administrations to become more transparent about sexual assault, a defining issue on campuses around the country.\n\nWith cuts at traditional news organizations, student journalists see their role as increasingly important in shedding light on the subject and are becoming more dogged in ferreting out information about sexual assault cases, particularly when faculty or student perpetrators could simply find other jobs or transfer to another university. Some are demanding that the student body be given details when a college confirms wrongdoing, particularly of a violent nature, by students, faculty or staff members.\n\nUniversities, though, often invoke privacy concerns in refusing to make details of inquiries public.\n\n\u201cThe critical question is whether we are able to continue protecting the confidentiality and privacy of victim-survivors who courageously come forward to report details of their victimization,\u201d wrote the University of Kentucky\u2019s president, Eli Capilouto, in a universitywide email.\n\n\u201cThe protection of victim-survivor privacy,\u201d the email continued, \u201crequires more than the redaction of names. It requires the redaction of any information that might reasonably lead to the identification of victim-survivors as well as the intimate details of the sexual assault.\u201d\n\nFrank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, a nonprofit organization, sees it another way. With state funding reductions and increasing competition for top students, colleges are more motivated than ever, he suggested, to maintain their reputations. \u201cThe stakes have increased for colleges to keep secrets,\u201d Mr. LoMonte said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting more aggressive.\u201d His group has helped student journalists fight to get documents and other information, and has worked to fend off funding cuts that students believe were in retaliation for controversial articles.\n\nAt Brandeis University, in Waltham, Mass., three staff members on The Justice, the student newspaper, were notified in February that they would be called to a university meeting \u2014 the first step in a disciplinary process \u2014 because the newspaper had audiotaped a public rally in 2015 at which students criticized the university\u2019s handling of sexual assault cases.\n\nSomeone had complained that the rally was recorded without permission, which the complainant viewed as possibly violating state law and college rules. The Justice had used the recordings for an article about the rally. No formal charges were filed, the university said, because it concluded that student journalists covering public events were within their rights to use recording devices.\n\n\u201cWe were very concerned that the student press at Brandeis was being targeted unfairly,\u201d said Ari Cohn, a lawyer with the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which aided the students. \u201cThe public relations issues around sexual assault on campus are massive right now. There\u2019s definitely a desire by universities to be out in front of those issues and to show they\u2019re taking this seriously. In some cases, like this one, that causes an overreaction.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Tar Heel, an independent publication at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, sued the university on Nov. 21 after officials refused to release details about sexual assault cases there. In a statement, the vice chancellor for communications, Joel Curran, said the university had a \u201cprofound responsibility to protect and vigorously defend the privacy of sexual assault victims and all students, including witnesses, who may be involved.\u201d\n\nBut Jane Wester, The Daily Tar Heel\u2019s editor, said, \u201cOnce someone has been found responsible for a violent offense, the university is under no obligation to keep that information private.\u201d At Indiana University, the independent Indiana Daily Student has been battling since September to obtain a 13-page report on the school\u2019s inquiry into sexual assault accusations against a former ballet instructor, Guoping Wang, who was arrested in July and charged with sexual battery of a student. The criminal case is pending.\n\nHannah Alani, the investigations editor for The Indiana Daily Student, said the university\u2019s refusal to release its report \u2013 partly on grounds that it is part of Mr. Wang\u2019s personnel file \u2014 fits a pattern in which the university has repeatedly declined requests related to sexual assault, prompting it to seek legal advice.\n\n\u201cIndiana University insists it takes sexual assault seriously,\u201d said Ms. Alani, whose newspaper has been aggressively covering campus sexual assault. \u201cBut when pressed for transparency on student and faculty cases, the university tells the public very little.\u201d\n\nAn Indiana spokeswoman, Margie Smith-Simmons, said the documents requested by the paper were not \u201cpublic records,\u201d and therefore could not be released.\n\nThe Kernel, which is partly financed by the University of Kentucky, has won numerous journalism awards. The university itself is home to a First Amendment Center endowed by the venerable Scripps Howard broadcasting and newspaper chain.\n\nThe paper\u2019s legal troubles began when it sought the records about the accusations against the professor. After the university refused to release the documents, the newspaper appealed to the state attorney general \u2014 the procedure under Kentucky law. The attorney general first ruled that the university should submit the documents to him for review in private. When it refused, he ruled that the university should release the documents to the newspaper with the names redacted.\n\nAs the dispute continued, the records in the case were leaked to the newspaper, which published an article based on them.\n\nEven though the records have already been disclosed, the university sued the paper to prevent the attorney general\u2019s order from establishing what it called a dangerous legal precedent, arguing that such a ruling would open the floodgates for the release of additional documents protected by student privacy provisions.\n\nJay Blanton, a university spokesman, defended the college\u2019s record on sexual assault cases over all, as well as its handling of the case involving the entomology professor, James Harwood. The professor, who did not respond to requests for comment, has denied the accusations. \u201cThe agreement with Dr. Harwood removed him from campus and prevented him from interacting with students immediately,\u201d Mr. Blanton said.\n\nThe case has pitted the college\u2019s journalism faculty against its president, Mr. Capilouto, who criticized the newspaper\u2019s coverage. \u201cThe president said that I published salacious details to gain readership,\u201d said Marjorie Kirk, the newspaper\u2019s editor. \u201cI am incredibly insulted.\u201d\n\nSupporters of The Kernel say the university\u2019s position may pose a public threat by permitting sexual predators to remain anonymous. At a meeting of university trustees, David Hawpe, a trustee and former editor of The Courier-Journal of Louisville, questioned whether the university was in danger of making the same kind of mistakes as the Catholic Church, which covered up sexual abuse by priests and permitted them to move from one parish to another.\n\nInternal emails released by the university reveal that Dr. Harwood, who has an impressive record of teaching and published research, was interviewing for other jobs at the time of his resignation.\n\nThe university argues that releasing information makes victims afraid to come forward, fearful that their cases will become public. The university has suggested a connection between The Kernel\u2019s reporting and a decline in reported campus sexual misconduct cases. Mr. Capilouto said the decline \u2014 to 38 reports this year compared with 59 in the same period last year \u2014 \u201cunderscores the chilling impact that news reports are having on the willingness of victim-survivors to come forward.\u201d And the professor\u2019s accusers, whose representative initially encouraged the newspaper to report on the case, are now supporting the university\u2019s position after a meeting with Mr. Capilouto.\n\nUnder its agreement with Dr. Harwood, who resigned in February, the university promised not to disparage the professor or disclose the agreement\u2019s existence unless someone filed an open records request or obtained a court order. In an email to a university dean, Dr. Harwood said he had been assured that the accusations would \u201cremain confidential, not on the public record, and not listed against my name.\u201d\n\nAs part of its agreement, the university continued his $109,000 annual pay through August.\n", "incorrect climate mail conclusions appeared cited global breitbart daily drew wrong experts temperatures scientists report news change data incomplete": "\nScientists on Friday debunked a widely circulated news media report suggesting that recent record-high global temperatures were unrelated to climate change.\n\nThe report, which first appeared in the British tabloid The Daily Mail and was summarized in Breitbart News, the right-wing opinion and news site, cited incomplete data and drew incorrect conclusions, the scientists said.\n\nFederal and international agencies have said that 2016 will likely be the hottest year on record, eclipsing the record set last year. In its report, The Daily Mail cited a recent decline in temperatures over land since the weather phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o ended this year, and said that El Ni\u00f1o, and not climate change, was responsible for the record heat.\n\nBut scientists said that while the recent El Ni\u00f1o did contribute to the record warmth, climate change played a major role, too.\n\n\u201cNobody said the record temperatures were exclusively the result of climate change,\u201d said Mike Halpert, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center.\n\nDeke Arndt, the chief of the climate monitoring branch at the NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, said that the long-term warming trend was quite clear, and that the impact of El Ni\u00f1o was in addition to what were already higher temperatures. \u201cYou can have both climate change and a goose from El Ni\u00f1o,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an El Ni\u00f1o, water temperatures increase in the eastern equatorial Pacific, affecting air temperatures and weather worldwide. Sea surface temperatures have declined since their peak earlier this year, and now the opposite condition \u2014 La Ni\u00f1a, with water temperatures lower than normal \u2014 prevails.\n\nScientists are not surprised that some global temperatures are falling and expect that temperatures next year will be below those of the past two years because of La Ni\u00f1a. \u201cBut it\u2019s still likely to be quite a bit warmer than average,\u201d Mr. Halpert said.\n\nScientists said the news media reports were also faulty in that they cited only temperatures over land, which account for about 30 percent of the earth\u2019s surface. Temperatures over land are much more variable than those over water because land stores relatively little heat.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be making global-scale assessments,\u201d Dr. Arndt said, \u201cyou need to be looking at global-scale data.\u201d\n\nGlobal data show a slower decline in temperatures than land-only data, scientists said.\n\nThe House Committee on Science, Space and Technology posted about the Breitbart News report on Twitter on Thursday. The committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, has accused the Obama administration of having a \u201csuspect climate agenda.\u201d\n\nThe House committee\u2019s Twitter post drew sharp rebukes from scientists and others, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote on Twitter referring to an academic expert cited in the article.\n\nThe Daily Mail report, which was written by David Rose, was also strongly disputed online. One blogger headlined a post on the subject: \u201cHow Stupid Does David Rose Think You Are?\u201d\n", "phones journalists canadian freedom freelance detention confiscated period alarms officials raises ed press entry photojournalist border denying questioned": "\nEd Ou, a Canadian freelance photojournalist, spent 10 years covering the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia. He endured aggressive interrogations at border crossings in some of the world\u2019s most authoritarian nations.\n\nBut he says a recent confrontation at the United States border has left him shaken. The incident has been criticized by advocates of privacy and press freedom.\n\nMr. Ou, 30, said he was detained on Oct. 1 for more than six hours when he tried to fly from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Bismarck, N.D., to cover the protests of an oil pipeline project near the Standing Rock reservation.\n\nHe was ultimately denied entry, and he said though he was not given a reason, he was told his name matched that of a \u201cperson of interest.\u201d During the hours of detention, he was asked to describe how and why he had traveled to each country he had visited in the past five years, and questioned about whether he had seen anyone die.\n\nAgents requested access to his phones and to look through his photos so that they could make sure he was \u201cnot posing next to any dead bodies,\u201d he said. When he refused, citing the need to protect his sources as a journalist, they took the phones, he said.\n\nThe phones were later returned and showed signs that the SIM cards had been replaced, he said. Giving up the contents of his private phone would be akin to a doctor giving up confidential patient information, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to open my phone for any other country,\u201d Mr. Ou, a New York Times contributor who was an intern for the news organization in 2010, said in a phone interview on Thursday from Nunavut, Canada. \u201cI can\u2019t be expected to do the same for the U.S.\u201d\n\nJason Givens, a United States Customs and Border Protection spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Ou\u2019s case, citing privacy laws. But he said agents had inspected 4,444 cellphones and 320 other electronic devices in 2015, amounting to 0.0012 percent of the 383 million arrivals.\n\n\u201cKeeping America safe and enforcing our nation\u2019s laws in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully examine all materials entering the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Givens said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security, protesting Mr. Ou\u2019s treatment and calling it \u201charassing and exceptionally intrusive.\u201d It demanded an explanation of his detention, and asked for a guarantee that any copies of his belongings had been destroyed.\n\nAgents made photocopies of several documents in his possession, including a personal journal, Mr. Ou said.\n\nIt should have been clear to agents that Mr. Ou was a working journalist who had traveled freely to the United States in the past and had longstanding connections to American news agencies, Hugh Handeyside, a lawyer, wrote in the A.C.L.U. letter.\n\n\u201cWe believe that C.B.P. took advantage of Mr. Ou\u2019s application for admission to engage in an opportunistic fishing expedition for sensitive and confidential information that Mr. Ou had gathered through his news-gathering activities in Turkey, Iraq, Somalia and elsewhere,\u201d he wrote.\n\nElectronic privacy advocates said the episode illustrated a governmental loophole that\u2019s especially problematic for journalists but that could apply to anyone: Without a warrant, American border agents can legally search digital devices that they wouldn\u2019t be able to touch anywhere else.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but the Supreme Court carved out space for border patrol agents to examine personal property without a warrant, said Sophia Cope, a staff lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization that defends civil liberties in the digital age.\n\nSecurity officers at United States airports don\u2019t need a judge\u2019s permission to search a traveler\u2019s backpack before he or she boards a flight the way a police officer would when stopping someone on the street. But it has to be for the narrow purpose of assuring immigration or security compliance, she said.\n\nThe privacy implications of examining a cellphone are entirely different from rifling through a suitcase, which contains limited personal information, Ms. Cope said. The law regarding digital devices is \u201creally unsettled,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe government is saying the old rule at the border applies to digital devices, even though our entire lives are on these devices,\u201d Ms. Cope said.\n\nA Homeland Security policy from 2009 says that searching digital devices requires the owner of the digital device to be present during the search, though it doesn\u2019t guarantee the owner can monitor the search. Agents can make copies of the data, but the copies must be destroyed within seven days if there is no probable cause to seize it. Devices can be detained for up to five days, barring \u201cextenuating circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe policy\u2019s assurance that agents would \u201cprotect that information from unauthorized disclosure\u201d is not particularly comforting for journalists, who fear the contents of their devices could unmask sources who would be in danger if the government learned their identities.\n\nMaria Abi-Habib, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, recounted a similar episode in a Facebook post in July after she was detained at Los Angeles International Airport and asked to turn over her cellphones. The request was eventually withdrawn after Ms. Abi-Habib, a United States citizen traveling on an American passport, objected and asked to call lawyers for her newspaper.\n\nTrevor Timm, the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said that for journalists like Mr. Ou who have worked in the Middle East to be treated with suspicion, potentially forcing them to break promises of confidentiality to sources just to enter the country, sets a poor international precedent, he said.\n\n\u201cIf this is requisite for journalists who are not U.S. citizens to enter the U.S., that is an enormous violation of press freedom,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ou was assigned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to cover the Standing Rock protests as part of a project on indigenous health care in North America. He said the agents knew he intended to cover the protests, which have prompted the police to use rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannons against hundreds of people.\n\nHis experience at the border led to an \u201cawful realization,\u201d Mr. Ou said: \u201cThat wall of na\u00efvet\u00e9 that I had about the freedom of the press in the U.S. kind of shattered at that moment.\u201d\n", "city kansas berrys huge beat nfl interception victory chiefs benched rams patriots seahawks cam scores panthers eric road gave": "\nCarolina quarterback Cam Newton was held out for the first series of Sunday night\u2019s game against Seattle, and it cost the Panthers a lead they would never get back.\n\nBackup Derek Anderson took the first offensive snap for Carolina with Newton standing on the sideline, and proceeded to throw an interception.\n\nAnderson\u2019s pass bounced off Mike Tolbert\u2019s hands and was intercepted by Seattle\u2019s Mike Morgan. Morgan returned the interception Carolina\u2019s 8-yard line, but the Panthers held Seattle to a 23-yard Steve Hauschka field goal.\n\nN.B.C.\u2019s Michele Tafoya reported at halftime that Newton was benched by Coach Ron Rivera for a dress code violation.\n\nNewton returned for Carolina\u2019s next offensive possession, but things didn\u2019t get much better from there. Behind the strong running of Thomas Rawls, the Seahawks won easily, 40-7. Newton finished with only 14 completions on 32 passes for 182 yards.\n\nThere was some bad news for the Seahawks, however, as All-Pro Safety Earl Thomas left the game with what was being reported as a broken leg.\n\nAmari Cooper was eight years old the last time the Oakland Raiders had a 10-win season, but his 37-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter was the go-ahead play in a dramatic 38-24 come-from-behind victory over the Buffalo Bills that improved the breakout team\u2019s record to 10-2.\n\nWinners of six consecutive games, the Raiders\u2019 offense has been machine-like, earning quarterback Derek Carr the cover of ESPN The Magazine among other accolades, and has the team tied with the New England Patriots for the best record in the A.F.C.\n\nBut with less than six minutes remaining in the third quarter, it looked like the winning streak could be in jeopardy, as the Raiders trailed the Bills 24-9.\n\nThe comeback, which included 29 unanswered points, was a total team effort as the offense got two touchdowns from Latavius Murray and one each from Michael Crabtree and Cooper. The go-ahead play by Cooper was a veteran move from a young receiver, as he did a double-fake on a slant-and-go, giving himself plenty of separation against rookie cornerback Kevon Seymour.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, the comeback also featured great play from the team\u2019s defense that had allowed 197 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns through three quarters but suddenly found a way to stop the hard-charging Bills. Khalil Mack, Oakland\u2019s standout linebacker, sealed up the victory with a sack and fumble late in the fourth quarter that ended the only promising drive for Buffalo after Oakland had come alive.\n\nThe turnaround on both sides of the ball was remarkable, as prior to the 29-point explosion, all of Oakland\u2019s scoring had come from three field goals by Sebastian Janikowski, the team\u2019s aging place-kicker and only remaining member of the 2002 team that won 11 games and earned a Super Bowl appearance, which was the last time Oakland qualified for the playoffs.\n\nOakland\u2019s next test will come after a short turn-around, as the team faces the Kansas City Chiefs on Thursday in a game that could go a long way to determining which team wins the A.F.C. West.\n\nIn an emotional return to his hometown, Eric Berry stole the show as the Kansas City Chiefs found creative ways to score, becoming just the second team to win a game as a result of a defensive two-point play. The rare conversion was the difference in a 29-28 win over the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nAtlanta had just scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Matt Ryan to Aldrick Robinson and tried to extend the lead to 30-27 with a 2-point conversion attempt. Ryan dropped back and threw to his left but Berry, Kansas City\u2019s standout defensive back, stepped right in front of the pass, returning it 99 yards for the score.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I do, man,\u201d Berry said in a televised interview after the game. \u201cWe talk about making plays throughout the week. We just embrace the process. Good things happen when you embrace the process.\u201d\n\nBerry, who worked his way back to N.F.L. stardom after missing most of the 2014 season to get treatment for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, grew up in Fairburn, Georgia and his homecoming game also included a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown. After the scoring play, he ran to the stands and gave the ball to his mother.\n\n\u201cI shed a few tears before the game, I shed a few tears during the game and I shed a few after,\u201d Berry told reporters. \u201cIt was just a lot of emotions. I tried to contain them and let it show through my play.\u201d\n\nThe odd win for Kansas City also included a fake punt that led to a 55-yard run by Albert Wilson and gave the Chiefs nine wins heading into a huge A.F.C. West matchup on Thursday against the division-leading Oakland Raiders.\n\nThe ability to return an extra-point or 2-point conversion attempt for a two-point score has only existed for two seasons, and the Denver Broncos became the first team to win a game with one in Week 10 when Will Parks returned a blocked extra-point for the game-winning score. Berry\u2019s version of the play, already dubbed a \u201cpick-two\u201d by some, was the first time a two-point defensive play has been the result of a failed 2-point conversion attempt rather than a blocked kick.\n\nThe New England Patriots may have lost some explosiveness on offense with the season-ending injury to Rob Gronkowski, but with the way the team\u2019s defense swallowed Jared Goff whole, a missing piece on New England\u2019s offense hardly seemed to matter as the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams, 26-10.\n\nGoff, who has yet to win a game since being taken with the No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s draft, looked every bit the rookie quarterback. He got almost no help from his receivers, who repeatedly dropped catchable passes, and paid the price for his attempts to get something going by throwing two interceptions.\n\nTom Brady, meanwhile, won the 201st game of his career (including postseason play), breaking a tie with Peyton Manning for the N.F.L. record. He did it with a mostly-conservative approach, but showed he could be explosive when he wanted with a perfect 14-yard pass to Chris Hogan in the corner of the end zone for New England\u2019s second touchdown.\n\nThe biggest offensive highlight of the game for the Patriots came from LeGarrette Blount, who did his best impression of an ankle-breaking N.B.A. point guard, juking past a flailing defensive back on his way to the end zone on a 43-yard run.\n\nThe total mismatch of a game was the seventh loss in eight games for the Rams, creating an awkward situation as Coach Jeff Fisher was expected to announce a contract extension after the game that will keep him with the team through 2018. Sunday\u2019s loss ensured that the Rams can finish no better than .500 this season, and almost assuredly will have be the team\u2019s fifth consecutive losing season under Fisher, who has produced a winning record in just six of his 20 full seasons. With 164 career losses Fisher is just one short of tying Dan Reeves for the N.F.L. record.\n\nAaron Rodgers threw for 209 yards and two touchdowns, and the Green Bay Packers pulled away from the Houston Texans with two fourth-quarter touchdowns for a 21-13 win Sunday to get back to .500. The Packers (6-6) weathered snowy conditions at Lambeau Field, making just enough plays on the cold turf to even their record for the first time since they were 4-4 after losing to Indianapolis on Nov. 6.\n\nBrock Osweiler connected with DeAndre Hopkins for a 44-yard touchdown pass with 1:51 left to get within eight for Houston. Nick Novak missed the extra point, with footing slippery at Lambeau.\n\nThe Texans (6-6) had one last shot after the Packers failed to run out the clock. But Osweiler\u2019s last-ditch pass-and-lateral play from Houston\u2019s 12 with 4 seconds left failed, handing Houston its third straight loss. \u2014 Associated Press\n\nSteelers Stop Giants: Over and over on Sunday, with the Giants\u2019 secondary devoting several defenders to cover the Steelers\u2019 fleet wide receivers deep down the field, Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger held the football as he waited for a teammate to break open. Waiting in the passing pocket, Roethlisberger must have had a Cheshire cat grin. He had the perfect countermove for the Giants\u2019 defensive strategy, one the Steelers may have planning all along.\n\nThe Steelers never trailed in their 24-14 victory over the Giants, with Pittsburgh\u2019s tight ends and running backs combining for more than 200 receiving yards. Roethlisberger, who threw two touchdown passes, spent most of the game targeting the middle of the field to avoid the Giants elite cornerback Janoris Jenkins. Poor Giants tackling further aided the Steelers cause. \u2014 Bill Pennington\n\nRavens End Dolphins\u2019 Streak: Joe Flacco threw for 381 yards and four touchdowns, and the Baltimore Ravens overwhelmed the Dolphins in the first half of a 38-6 victory Sunday that ended Miami\u2019s six-game winning streak.\n\nBaltimore (7-5) led 24-0 at halftime behind Flacco and a dominant performance from the league\u2019s second-ranked defense. Flacco went 27 for 34 for 258 yards and three scores over the first 30 minutes, and the Ravens yielded only 115 yards and intercepted a Ryan Tannehill pass. \u2014 Associated Press\n\nCardinals Top Redskins: Carson Palmer threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns, David Johnson scored twice and the Arizona Cardinals held on to beat the Washington Redskins 31-23 on Sunday. The loss by the Redskins (6-5-1) clinched a playoff spot for the 11-1 Dallas Cowboys. Palmer\u2019s 25-yard touchdown pass to Johnson with 11:09 to play put Arizona ahead 24-20, the fourth lead change of the second half. \u2014 Associated Press\n\nDenver\u2019s Defense Saves the Day: Bradley Roby returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown, helping the Denver Broncos beat the mistake-prone Jacksonville Jaguars 20-10 on Sunday and gain ground in the AFC playoff picture.\n\nRoby picked off Blake Bortles\u2019 wobbler across the middle in the third quarter and went untouched the other way. Star linebacker Von Miller hit Bortles as he released the ball. It was the 11th pick-6 of Bortles\u2019 three-year career and his third in the last four games. Houston and Detroit also returned interceptions for touchdowns in games the Jaguars lost by less than seven points. \u2014 Associated Press\n\nAt one point earlier in the season, Carson Wentz of the Philadelphia Eagles appeared to be on the fast track to being named the N.F.L.\u2019s rookie of the year. He led his team to wins in his first three games and was showing a veteran-like ability to avoid interceptions.\n\nThat feels like a distant memory as Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys has surpassed Wentz in terms of hype, wins and statistics. In yet another brutal loss, Wentz, who was the No. 2 pick in this year\u2019s draft, completed 36 of 60 passes for 308 yards, 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions against the lowly Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, losing 32-14.\n\nWentz has thrown six interceptions in his last three starts and the Eagles have lost seven of the team\u2019s last nine games.\n\nPrescott, meanwhile, the 135th pick in the draft, has won 11 consecutive games after a loss in Week 1, and has just 2 interceptions to go with 19 touchdowns passes.\n", "regain muscles works process age men people young older bulking mass build strong muscle women": "\nLet\u2019s start with the good news about aging muscles. You can rebuild them, even if you are middle-aged or older. \n\n\u201cOur lab and others have shown repeatedly\u201d that older muscles will grow and strengthen, says Marcas Bamman, a professor of integrative biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In his studies, men and women in their 60s and 70s who began supervised weight training developed muscles that were as large and strong as those of your average 40-year-old.\n\nBut the process of bulking up works differently in older people than in the young, he said. \n\nSkeletal muscles are composed of various types of fibers and \u201ctwo things happen\u201d to those fibers after we reach middle age, Dr. Bamman says. Some die, especially if we have not been exercising our muscles much. Sedentary adults can lose 30 to 40 percent of the total number of fibers in their muscles by the time they are 55, Dr. Bamman says. \n\nOthers of the fibers remain alive but shrink and atrophy as we age.\n\nYoung people who work out add new muscle fibers and also plump up their existing ones. Older people do not. We increase the size of our atrophied muscle fibers with exercise but, for a variety of physiological reasons, do not add to the number of fibers, Dr. Bamman says. \n\nBut in practical terms, who cares? Older muscles will become larger and stronger if you work them, Dr. Bamman says. \n\nThe key, he continues, is regular and progressive weight training. If you don\u2019t belong to a gym, consider joining one, and then plan on tiring yourself. In order to initiate the biochemical processes that lead to larger, stronger fibers, Dr. Bamman says, you should push your muscles until they are exhausted. \n\nIn his studies, volunteers used weights calibrated so that the lifters could barely complete a set of eight to 12 repetitions before their arms or legs grew leaden and they had to rest. They repeated each set two or three times and visited the gym three times per week. If you are new to weight workouts, ask for an orientation at your gym or consult an athletic trainer who often works with older clients. \n\nDo you have a health question?\n\t\t Submit your question to Ask Well.\n", "unforeseeable annual increased chain web food year arctic global percent results ocean production base scientists estimated alters warming greening": "\nThe Arctic Ocean may seem remote and forbidding, but to birds, whales and other animals, it\u2019s a top-notch dining destination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great place to get food in the summertime, so animals are flying or swimming thousands of miles to get there,\u201d said Kevin R. Arrigo, a biological oceanographer at Stanford University.\n\nBut the menu is changing. Confirming earlier research, scientists reported Wednesday that global warming is altering the ecology of the Arctic Ocean on a huge scale.\n\nThe annual production of algae, the base of the food web, increased an estimated 47 percent between 1997 and 2015, and the ocean is greening up much earlier each year.\n\nThese changes are likely to have a profound impact for animals further up the food chain, such as birds, seals, polar bears and whales. But scientists still don\u2019t know enough about the biology of the Arctic Ocean to predict what the ecosystem will look like in decades to come.\n\nWhile global warming has affected the whole planet in recent decades, nowhere has been hit harder than the Arctic. This month, temperatures in the high Arctic have been as much as 36 degrees above average, according to records kept by the Danish Meteorological Institute.\n\nIn October, the extent of sea ice was 28.5 percent below average \u2014 the lowest for the month since scientists began keeping records in 1979. The area of missing ice is the size of Alaska and Texas put together.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, researchers like Dr. Arrigo have been trying to assess the effects of retreating ice on the Arctic ecosystem.\n\nThe sun returns to the Arctic each spring and melts some of the ice that formed in winter. Algae in the open water quickly spring to life and start growing.\n\nThese algae are the base of the food chain in the Arctic Ocean, grazed by krill and other invertebrates that in turn support bigger fish, mammals and birds.\n\nDr. Arrigo and his colleagues visited the Arctic in research ships to examine algae in the water and to determine how it affected the water\u2019s color. They then reviewed satellite images of the Arctic Ocean, relying on the color of the water to estimate how much algae was growing \u2014 what scientists call the ocean\u2019s productivity.\n\nThe sea\u2019s productivity was rapidly increasing, Dr. Arrigo found. Last year he and his colleagues published their latest update, estimating that the productivity of the Arctic rose 30 percent between 1998 and 2012.\n\nBut Mati Kahru, an oceanographer at the University of California, San Diego, was skeptical. As an expert on remote sensing, he knew how hard it is to get a reliable picture of the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe ocean is notoriously cloudy, and algae are not the only thing that tinting the water. Rivers deliver tea-colored organic matter into the Arctic Ocean, which can give the impression that there\u2019s more algae in the water than is actually there.\n\nDr. Kahru and his colleagues decided to take an independent look, scouring satellite databases for images taken from 1997 to 2015 \u2014 \u201cevery image available,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scientists used a mathematical equation to determine how the color in each pixel of each image was determined by algae, runoff, and other factors. Dr. Kahru decided that Dr. Arrigo was right: The Arctic Ocean has become vastly more productive.\n\nMarcel Babin, an oceanographer at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec who was not involved in the new study, said that the researchers had done \u201cvery careful work\u201d that confirmed the earlier studies. \u201cIt\u2019s an important finding,\u201d he said.\n\nNot only is the Arctic Ocean producing more algae, but it\u2019s doing so sooner each year. \u201cThese blooms are coming earlier, sometimes two months earlier,\u201d Dr. Kahru said.\n\nIn fact, the bloom may be coming even sooner than satellites can record. On research cruises, Dr. Arrigo and his colleagues have found that open water is no longer a requirement for algae to grow.\n\nThe ice has gotten so thin that sunlight reaches through it. \u201cNow they\u2019re not even waiting for the ice to melt,\u201d said Dr. Arrigo said of algal organisms.\n\nIf we stay on our current course, pouring more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the Arctic will only get warmer, perhaps becoming ice-free in the summer. If algae can find more nitrogen and other nutrients in the ocean, its productivity may continue to rise.\n\nScientists can\u2019t yet say what the ecological effects of this transformation will be. \u201cIt is probable it will have an impact on the whole food web,\u201d Dr. Babin said.\n\nDr. Babin and his colleagues have been studying that impact over the past two summers on an expedition called the Green Edge Project, which has studied the ecology in Baffin Bay off the coast of northern Canada. They hope to present the first results of the survey next year.\n\nSome species may thrive because they can graze on the extra algae. But if the ecosystem comes to life earlier in the year, many species may be left behind.\n\nFish larvae may not be able to develop fast enough. Migrating whales and birds may show up too late. A lot of the extra algae may drop to the sea floor by then, untouched.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different Arctic unless we turn things around,\u201d said Dr. Arrigo.\n", "summer supreme burial requiring focus past facilities cremation court perform pay state front texas shifted seeking abortions losing case places obstacles remains fetal": "\nMIAMI \u2014 Despite losing a milestone abortion case at the United States Supreme Court this past summer, Texas threw down another stumbling block this week. It will require facilities that provide abortions to pay for the cremation or burial of fetal remains, rather than dispose of them as biological medical waste.\n\nIt is the latest attempt by abortion opponents to make it more burdensome for women to get abortions \u2014 by creating new rules and laws that make it more difficult for providers to stay in business. In finalizing its rule on Monday, Texas joined at least three other states \u2014 Arkansas, Louisiana and Indiana \u2014 that have called for the burial or cremation of aborted fetal remains. With lawsuits pending, the regulations in Indiana and Louisiana have not yet gone into effect.\n\nThe regulations regarding the disposal of remains were rewritten in Texas to \u201cprotect the dignity of the unborn,\u201d a move that has been championed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican and a staunch opponent of abortion.\n\nFirst published in the summer, the new regulations have been in the works for the past year, and have received scores of comments, both positive and negative. The regulations, which take effect Dec. 19, immediately raised questions about the effect they would have on abortion health care providers, women who seek abortions or even funeral directors in Texas who worry this could increase their costs, as well.\n\nThe new regulations do not apply to women who miscarry at home; they affect only those women who have abortions or miscarry at health care facilities. They also apply to women who undergo abortions because of ectopic pregnancies \u2014 pregnancies that involve fertilized eggs that implant outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tube, and can result in a rupture.\n\nAbortion rights organizations said they are still reviewing the rules and have not decided whether to file a lawsuit. But they said the regulations appear to contradict a June ruling by the United States Supreme Court, which found that restrictions on abortions must serve a public health purpose.\n\n\u201cThis only affects how a licensed medical facility, like a hospital, disposes of this tissue,\u201d said Blake Rocap, the legislative counsel for Naral in Texas. \u201cWhich of course makes it clear that there is no real public health interest in having this regulation. It\u2019s perfectly O.K. for the tissue to be disposed of at home, if it\u2019s the result of a spontaneous miscarriage or a medical abortion that takes place at home.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights supporters said they worry the rules may dissuade women who are miscarrying at home to seek medical attention because of the cost of the new requirement. Although insurance providers must pay for it, some of the costs will probably be passed on to the women who seek abortions or treatment, supporters said.\n\nMore important, though, they said the decision to seek an abortion is difficult enough for many women, without adding the emotional pain of knowing the remains will either be cremated or buried.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s designed to shame and stigmatize women who choose abortion or suffer miscarriage by associating that not with the standard respectful treatment of people in medical care but with death,\u201d said David Brown, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights who has worked on the issue.\n\nSimilar concerns are shared by funeral services directors. Michael Land, a former president for the Texas Funeral Directors Association who is now the group\u2019s spokesman, said he wonders about the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d effect on women and families involved. \u201cYou are subjecting a lot of women to dealing with situations that is just making their grief process worse.\u201d\n\nThe association has not taken an official position on the rules changes, but Mr. Land said that funeral directors are worried about the cost. While it is too early to know how the rules will affect them, they anticipate having to hire additional staff, particularly in cities.\n\nThe remains do not have to be buried or put in a permanent repository; they can be scattered, which is a cheaper option.\n\nThe average cost of cremating an infant is $125, Mr. Land said. The state has said it anticipates the cost for each facility would be $450 a year, which could be offset by the money that facilities once paid to dispose of remains at a landfill. \u201cWe do not feel it was fully thought out,\u201d Mr. Land added. \u201cIf we have to hire personnel and additional staffing that raises the cremation fee up to several hundred dollars.\u201d\n\nBut supporters of the new rules said that fetal remains and tissue are the same as human remains and tissue. They are no different and deserve to be given a dignified resting place.\n\nMr. Abbott has agreed, and has expressed a desire to push for the rules to be codified.\n\n\u201cGovernor Abbott believes human and fetal remains should not be treated like medical waste, and the proposed rule changes affirms the value and dignity of all life,\u201d Ciara Matthews, a spokeswoman for the governor, said in a statement.\n", "picture climate scale barrier government paints area threatened great grim wellmanaged chemicals risks reef protecting report unesco australian sediment change": "\nSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Climate change and the flow of farm chemicals and coastal sediment into the waters that wash over one of Australia\u2019s most significant nature areas, the Great Barrier Reef, pose the biggest threats to its survival, according to a government report to Unesco released early Friday.\n\nThe report was intended to reassure the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization that those risks were well managed and that the reef should not be placed on an \u201cin danger\u201d list. But it paints a grim picture of the scale of protecting the 1,400-mile-long reef, and may severely understate the cost of doing so.\n\nThe report also ignores plans by the Queensland State government to allow the development of one of the world\u2019s biggest coal mines about 200 miles from the reef, and it does not acknowledge the damage to the reef that could flow from the mine.\n\nThis week, scientists from the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies reported that the reef had suffered the worst coral bleaching and die-off ever recorded, with stretches of its northern reaches dead after the coral was bathed in warm summer waters.\n\nQueensland\u2019s environment minister, Steven Miles, and the federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, who is also responsible for Australia\u2019s energy policy, said in the report that \u201cgood progress has been made in the first 18 months of this 35-year plan.\u201d They were referring to the governments\u2019 Reef 2050 Plan, released in March 2015.\n\nThe update shows that of 151 planned measures, including the limiting of sediment and chemical runoff from farms and the better management of starfish predators, 32 have been completed and 103 are underway or on track to begin. At least one is stalled, after the Queensland Parliament rejected laws to prevent land clearing, which speeds erosion and can lead to more sediment flowing into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBut in an introduction to the report, Ian Chubb, formerly Australia\u2019s chief scientist and now the chairman of an independent panel on the reef, warned that climate change posed the most significant threat. \u201cThe major impacts on the reef will most likely result from the long-term release of substantial quantities of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere are effects already,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis year saw the most significant coral bleaching event ever recorded for the reef.\u201d\n\nReef 2050 was a response to the Unesco World Heritage Committee\u2019s call for a long-term management plan to ensure the reef retained the World Heritage status it received in 1981. Last year, the United Nations warned that the reef\u2019s outlook was poor, and it asked for an updated report and for evidence of the plan\u2019s effectiveness, as well as an investment strategy to finance the efforts.\n\nIn the interim, the Queensland government commissioned a study to estimate the costs of achieving water quality targets that would significantly improve the reef\u2019s health. Queensland and the federal government have said that halting nitrogen runoff from farms and fine sediment that leeches into the ocean would improve the water quality and allow the reef to better withstand the impacts of climate change and shocks from severe weather like cyclones.\n\nThat study, released in July, said the cost for meeting targets along the length of the reef was 8.2 billion Australian dollars, or about $6 billion, to be spent over 10 years. That figure was sharply higher than the roughly $1.5 billion the state and federal governments said would be spent over the next decade on all measures to protect the reef.\n\n\u201cThe scale of the investment required is commensurate with the scale of the challenge,\u201d the study said. \u201cVirtually all of the relevant science indicates the Great Barrier Reef is in decline.\u201d\n\nThe report to Unesco on Friday said that about $950 million had already been committed to reef-specific measures over the next five years. That amount is part of the federal and the state governments\u2019 $1.5 billion commitment over a decade.\n\nThe federal and Queensland governments said the study\u2019s overall cost estimate included \u201csome very expensive high-risk actions,\u201d like nearly $4.2 billion for erosion in one valley to prevent the flow of sediment into the ocean. Removal of that big-ticket item brought the study\u2019s report closer into line financially with the government report to Unesco.\n\nThe report on Friday was only an update. It did not offer new spending measures for the reef, nor new targets to reduce pollution. It is likely to draw sharp criticism from environmentalists.\n\nThe government ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change last month. The agreement\u2019s target is to cut greenhouse gas emissions to between 26 percent and 28 percent of 2005 levels by 2030. But environmentalists say the development of new coal mines highlights the government\u2019s lack of commitment to halting global warming.\n\nThe report to Unesco said the reef\u2019s scale and resilience meant it could recover from the bleaching this year. It said that managing the risks to the reef would be difficult, but that there was a determination to succeed. \u201cThe progress to date does not reduce the urgency to address key issues and risks,\u201d it said.\n", "earths instructional space provide probe japanese hoped weather inhospitable orbiting venus understanding insights": "\nVenus is not a placid paradise \u2014 that much we know. In addition to searing surface temperatures, wind in the upper atmosphere howls at up to 250 miles per hour, carrying clouds around the planet once every four days.\n\nYet Venus itself spins very slowly: one rotation every 243 Earth days \u2014 in the wrong direction, no less, opposite to almost every other body in the solar system.\n\nOn the whole, the atmosphere on Earth rotates about the same speed as the planet. So why does the air on slow-spinning Venus speed around so much faster than the planet itself?\n\nThe Japanese space probe Akatsuki, now in orbit around Venus, seeks to solve the mystery of so-called super-rotation. Scientists working on the mission are presenting some of their early findings at a meeting this week of the American Astronomical Society\u2019s Division for Planetary Sciences in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nThat is not just an idle trivia question for planetary scientists. Computer models of our own weather fail when applied to Venus, and knowledge of the planet\u2019s workings could better our understanding of Earth\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is the missing point in meteorology,\u201d said Masato Nakamura, Akatsuki\u2019s project manager. \u201cIf we know what makes such a super-rotation, we will have a much deeper understanding of the atmospheric dynamics, not just on Venus but also on Earth. We will learn much more about the Earth climate.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Venus has been a backwater of planetary exploration, even though it is much closer in size to Earth than is Mars. For a long time, scientists imagined there could be a habitable tropical paradise beneath Venus\u2019s thick clouds.\n\nIn the late 1950s, intense thermal emissions, measured by a radio telescope on Earth, told a different story. Venus broils.\n\nThe average surface temperature is more than 850 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 an extreme demonstration of the heat-trapping prowess of carbon dioxide, the primary constituent of the Venusian atmosphere. Clouds of sulfuric acid make it an even less appealing place to visit.\n\nIn the 1990s, NASA\u2019s Magellan spacecraft precisely mapped the topography of Venus through radar. Except for a few flybys by spacecraft on the way to somewhere else, NASA has not returned to Venus, although the agency is considering two modest proposals.\n\nA European mission, Venus Express, studied the planet from 2006 to 2014, discovering among other things a frigid layer of atmosphere, minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit at an altitude of 75 miles, sandwiched between two warmer layers.\n\nBut now Akatsuki, which entered orbit last December, has begun its work. Takehiko Satoh, one of the mission scientists, said that one of \u201cthe most exciting, most surprising results\u201d so far came almost immediately after the spacecraft arrived.\n\nThe camera that captures long-wavelength infrared light from the cloud tops discovered an arc-shaped white streak that stretched some 6,000 miles from nearly the south pole to nearly the north pole.\n\nCuriously, this giant atmospheric feature does not move with the atmosphere. \u201cIt seems to be fixed to the ground,\u201d Dr. Satoh said.\n\nThe arc sits above Aphrodite Terra, a highland region about the size of Africa that rises up to three miles from the surface. Scientists working on data from the Venus Express reported a similar finding in July.\n\nOne possibility is that as the wind blows over Aphrodite Terra, clouds are pushed higher and the temperature of the cloud tops falls. \u201cOur interpretation is there is some disturbance from the high mountain,\u201d Dr. Nakamura said.\n\nDr. Satoh said there were primarily two competing ideas for where the energy for the Venus wind comes from. One is that energy coming from the sun accelerates the wind. The second is that atmosphere is so thick that it gradually slows down the spinning of the planet, and that angular momentum is transferred to the air.\n\nAccording to this theory, even though breezes on the surface are slight \u2014 a couple of miles per hour \u2014 the speeds increase at higher altitudes as the air thins.\n\nThe small spacecraft \u2014 the main body is a box a bit bigger than a refrigerator \u2014 carries five cameras, collecting light at different wavelengths to monitor the Venusian atmosphere at different altitudes.\n\nIn another experiment, scientists will observe how the radio signal from the spacecraft to Earth is distorted when it passes through the atmosphere. That will reveal temperature, abundance of sulfuric acid vapor and other properties. By observing the atmosphere at different altitudes, they can detect wavelike features that rise and fall, like blobs in a lava lamp.\n\n\u201cIf the solar heating or thermal tide hypothesis is correct,\u201d Dr. Satoh said, \u201cwe may see different propagation of the wave, from cloud top to the lower level.\u201d If the viscosity theory is correct, the waves should propagate in the opposite direction, from the ground to the clouds.\n\nPerhaps the answers will become clear in a year \u2014 or maybe four. \u201cWe need to analyze a lot of big data,\u201d Dr. Nakamura said.\n\nThat Akatsuki, which means \u201cdawn\u201d in Japanese, is there at all is the result of ingenuity and perseverance.\n\nIt launched in May 2010 and arrived at Venus seven months later. But when its main engine failed to fire properly, it sailed right past the planet.\n\n\u201cIt was a very sad moment,\u201d Dr. Satoh said.\n\nWithin a day, Dr. Satoh said, calculations indicated that in six years, Akatsuki, in orbit around the sun instead of Venus, could meet up with Venus again. But it was not clear the spacecraft still would be able to slow down and enter orbit.\n\nAn investigation found that a valve in the engine had leaked, leading to the formation of salts that fused it shut. The engine, as it fired, had overheated beyond repair.\n\nAkatsuki still had the maneuvering thrusters that were to be used after it entered orbit. They were not as powerful as the broken engine, but they could apply enough force to slow it down enough so that Venus\u2019 gravity could capture it.\n\nBecause of worries that the longer stay in space, with the bombardment of solar radiation and cosmic rays, would degrade the instruments, the craft was maneuvered so the second rendezvous would occur a year earlier, in November 2015.\n\nThen calculations suggested that orbit might not be stable, and the spacecraft might crash into Venus shortly afterward. Another adjustment pushed the arrival back a couple of weeks to Dec. 7, exactly five years after the original arrival date.\n\nThis time, everything worked.\n\nThe Akatsuki\u2019s orbit is different from the one originally envisioned. Instead of being synchronized to the spinning atmosphere, which would have allowed scientists to better track small changes, the spacecraft now loops around Venus in a large elliptical orbit.\n\nThat provides different benefits. Instead of intently staring at one spot, seeing the smallest changes, scientists are now able to see what happens on a global scale, although they will miss some of the details.\n\nAkatsuki is to continue operating until at least April 2018, depending on how much fuel it has left. \u201cWe know at least we have one kilogram of fuel,\u201d said Dr. Nakamura, likening the uncertainty to an imprecise fuel gauge in a car.\n\nIf it turns out that Akatsuki has more, the spacecraft could continue operating for perhaps up to six years, he said.\n", "times selected notable poetry fiction books editors nonfiction review years book york": "\nThe year\u2019s notable fiction, poetry and nonfiction, selected by the editors of The New York Times Book Review.

A few minutes in the sun will fry your skin. Brains and fingers go numb. At night, the stars are so close they seem tangled in your hair.\n\nTwo years ago, this mountaintop was the scene of a cosmic traffic jam: honking horns, vans and trucks full of astronomers, V.I.P.s, journalists, businesspeople, politicians, protesters and police \u2014 all snarled at a roadblock just short of the summit.\n\nAbandoning their cars, some of the visitors started to hike up the hill toward what would have been a groundbreaking for the biggest and most expensive stargazing machinery ever built in the Northern Hemisphere: the Thirty Meter Telescope, 14 years and $1.4 billion in the making.\n\nThey were assembling on a plateau just below the summit, when Joshua Mangauil, better known by his Hawaiian name of Lanakila, then 27, barged onto the scene. Resplendent in a tapa cloth, beads, a red loin cloth, his jet black hair in a long Mohawk, he had hiked over the volcano\u2019s cinder cones barefoot.\n\n\u201cLike snakes you are. Vile snakes,\u201d he yelled. \u201cWe gave all of our aloha to you guys, and you slithered past us like snakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what? For your greed to look into the sky? You guys can\u2019t take care of this place.\u201d\n\nNo ground was broken that day or since.\n\nTo astronomers, the Thirty Meter Telescope would be a next-generation tool to spy on planets around other stars or to peer into the cores of ancient galaxies, with an eye sharper and more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, another landmark in humanity\u2019s quest to understand its origins.\n\nBut to its opponents, the telescope would be yet another eyesore despoiling an ancient sacred landscape, a gigantic 18-story colossus joining the 13 telescopes already on Mauna Kea.\n\nLater this month, proponents and opponents of the giant telescope will face off in a hotel room in the nearby city of Hilo for the start of hearings that will lead to a decision on whether the telescope can be legally erected on the mountain.\n\nOver the years, some have portrayed this fight as a struggle between superstition and science. Others view the telescope as another symbol of how Hawaiians have been unfairly treated since Congress annexed the islands \u2014 illegally in the eyes of many \u2014 in 1898. And still others believe it will bring technology and economic development to an impoverished island.\n\n\u201cThis is a very simple case about land use,\u201d Kealoha Pisciotta, a former telescope operator on Mauna Kea who has been one of the leaders of a group fighting telescope development on the mountain for the last decade. \u201cIt\u2019s not science versus religion. We\u2019re not the church. You\u2019re not Galileo.\u201d\n\nHanging in the balance is perhaps the best stargazing site on Earth. \u201cMauna Kea is the flagship of American and international astronomy,\u201d said Doug Simons, the director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. \u201cWe are on the precipice of losing this cornerstone of U.S. prestige.\u201d\n\nThe road to the stars once ended in California at Palomar Mountain, whose 200-inch-diameter telescope was long considered the size limit. The bigger a telescope mirror is, the more light it can capture and the fainter and farther it can see \u2014 out in space, back in time.\n\nIn the 1990s, however, astronomers learned how to build telescopes with thin mirrors that relied on computer-adjusted supports to keep them from sagging or warping.\n\nThere was an explosion of telescope building that has culminated, for now, in plans for three giant billion-dollar telescopes: the European Extremely Large Telescope and the Giant Magellan, both in Chile, and the Thirty Meter Telescope.\n\nNot only would they have a Brobdingnagian appetite for light, but they are designed to incorporate a new technology called adaptive optics, which can take the twinkle out of starlight by adjusting telescope mirrors to compensate for atmospheric turbulence.\n\nRichard Ellis, a British astronomer now at the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany, recalled being optimistic in 1999 when he arrived at the California Institute of Technology to begin developing what became known as the Thirty Meter Telescope. \u201cThe stock market was booming,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything seemed possible.\u201d\n\nCanada, India and Japan eventually joined the project, now officially known as the TMT International Observatory. It has been helped along by  the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, formed by the founder of Intel, which has contributed advice and $180 million.\n\nThe telescope, originally scheduled to be completed by 2024, is modeled on the revolutionary 10-meter-diameter Keck telescopes that Caltech and the University of California operate on Mauna Kea. Like them, it will have with a segmented mirror composed of small, hexagonal pieces of glass fitted together into an expanse wider than a tennis court.\n\nThere are only a few places on Earth that are dark, dry and calm enough to be fit for a billion-dollar telescope.\n\nRising 33,000 feet from the seafloor, Mauna Kea is one of the biggest mountains in the solar system. The dormant ancient volcano has been the center of Polynesian culture \u2014 the umbilical cord connecting Earth and sky \u2014 seemingly forever.\n\nThe mountain is part of so-called \u201cceded lands\u201d that originally belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom and are now administered by the state for the benefit of Hawaiians.\n\nOn its spare, merciless summit, craters and cinder cones of indefinable age keep company with a variety pack of architectural shapes housing telescopes.\n\nIn 1968 the University of Hawaii took out a 65-year lease on 11,000 acres for a dollar a year. Some 500 acres of that are designated as a science preserve. It includes the ice age quarry from which stone tools were being cut a thousand years ago, and hundreds of shrines and burial grounds.\n\nThe first telescope went up in 1970. Many rapidly followed.\n\nPlaces like Mauna Kea are \u201ccradles of knowledge,\u201d said Natalie Batalha, one of the leaders of NASA\u2019s Kepler planet-hunting mission. \u201cI am filled with reverence and humility every time I get to be physically present at a mountaintop observatory.\u201d\n\nBut some Hawaiians worried that knowledge was coming at too great a cost.\n\n\u201cAll those telescopes got put up with no thought beyond reviving the Hilo economy,\u201d said Michael Bolte, an astronomer from the University of California, Santa Cruz, who serves on the TMT board.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of thought was given to culture issues.\u201d\n\nSome native Hawaiians complained that their beloved mountain had grown \u201cpimples,\u201d and that the telescope development had interfered with cultural and religious practices that are protected by state law.\n\nConstruction trash sometimes rolled down the mountain, said Nelson Ho, a photographer and Sierra Club leader who complained to the university. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just kept playing king of the mountain.\u201d\n\nAn audit by the State of Hawaii in 1998 scolded the university for failing to protect the mountain and its natural and cultural resources. An environmental impact study performed by NASA in 2007 similarly concluded that 30 years of astronomy had caused \u201csignificant, substantial and adverse\u201d harm to Mauna Kea.\n\nThe tide began to shift in 2001 when NASA announced a plan to add six small telescopes called outriggers to the Keck complex. The outriggers would be used in concert with the big telescopes as interferometers to test ideas a for a future space mission dedicated to looking for planets around other stars.\n\nMs. Pisciotta led a band of environmentalists and cultural practitioners who went to court to stop NASA. The group included the Hawaiian chapter of the Sierra Club and the Royal Order of Kamehameha, devoted to restoring the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nMs. Pisciotta said she had once dreamed of being a cosmologist but lacked the requisite math skills and instead took a night job operating a radio telescope on Mauna Kea. She became disenchanted when a family shrine disappeared from the summit and the plans for the outriggers impinged on a cinder cone.\n\n\u201cCinder cones are burial sites. It\u2019s time to not let this go on,\u201d she said. The group prepared for court by reading popular books about trials.\n\nIn 2007, Hawaii\u2019s third district court found the management plan for the outriggers was flawed and revoked the building permit.\n\n\u201cNASA packed up and left,\u201d Ms. Pisciotta said.\n\nThe prospective builders of the TMT knew they had their work cut out for them.\n\nIn 2007, the Moore Foundation hired Peter Adler, a consultant and sociologist, to look into the consequences of putting the telescope in Hawaii.\n\n\u201cShould TMT decide to pursue a Mauna Kea site,\u201d his report warned, \u201cit will inherit the anger, fear and great mistrust generated through previous telescope planning and siting failures and an accumulated disbelief that any additional projects, especially a physically imposing one like the TMT, can be done properly.\u201d\n\nThe astronomers picked a telescope site that was less anthropologically sensitive, on a plateau below the summit with no monuments or other obvious structures on it. They agreed to pay $1 million a year, a fifth of which would go to the state\u2019s Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the rest to stewardship of the mountain.\n\nQuietly, they also pledged another $2 million a year toward science and technology education and work force development on the island of Hawaii. The Moore Foundation also put some $2 million into the Imiloa Astronomy Center, a museum and planetarium run by the University of Hawaii.\n\nDr. Bolte, a mild-mannered U.C.S.C. professor with a soothing lilt to his voice, became one of the most visible promoters of the project in community meetings.\n\nHe recalled going to a meeting in Hilo once where tensions were very high. Afterward, he said, he was afraid to go out to his car.\n\nSure enough, a crowd rushed him when he got there. \u201cWhat kind of astronomy do you do?\u201d they asked eagerly.\n\n\u201cThe aloha spirit really exists,\u201d Dr. Bolte said.\n\n\u201cExploring the universe is a wonderful thing humans do,\u201d he added. Nevertheless, \u201cthere was a core we never won over.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, we might have underestimated the strength of the sovereignty movement.\u201d\n\nIn the years since the first telescopes went up on Mauna Kea, Hawaiian people and culture had experienced a resurgence of pride known as the Hawaiian Renaissance.\n\nIn 1976, a band of Hawaiians sailed the outrigger canoe Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti. The feat showed how ancient Polynesians could have purposefully explored and colonized the Pacific, navigating the seas using only the sun, stars, ocean swells and wind.\n\n\u201cAnd that was the first spark of shutting up everybody who said that we were inferior, that we were not intelligent,\u201d Mr. Mangauil, the protester, said.\n\nIn 1978, the state recognized Hawaiian, which once had been banned from schools, as an official language.\n\nWith rising pride came \u2014 at least among some more vocal native Hawaiians \u2014 questions about whether the occupation and annexation of Hawaii by the United States in the 1890s was legal.\n\nTelescopes on a sacred mountain constitute a form of \u201ccolonial violence,\u201d in the words of J. Kehaulani Kauanui, an anthropologist at Wesleyan University.\n\nOr as Robert Kirshner, a Harvard professor who is now also chief science officer at the Moore Foundation, put it, \u201cThe question in that case become not so much whether you did the environmental impact statement right, but whose island is it?\u201d\n\nHaving cut their teeth fighting the outrigger project, Ms. Pisciotta\u2019s group, known informally as the Mauna Kea Hui, was prepared when the TMT Corporation formally selected the mountain for its site in 2009.\n\nMany Hawaiians welcomed the telescope project. At a permit hearing, Wallace Ishibashi Jr., whose family had an ancestral connection to Mauna Kea, compared the Thirty Meter\u2019s mission to the search for aumakua, the ancestral origins of the universe.\n\n\u201cHawaiians,\u201d he said, \u201chave always been a creative and adaptive people.\u201d\n\nMs. Pisciotta and her friends argued among other things that an 18-story observatory, which would be the biggest structure on the whole island of Hawaii, did not fit in a conservation district.\n\nIn a series of hearings in 2010 and 2011, the state land board approved a permit for the telescope but then stipulated that no construction could begin until a so-called contested case hearing, in which interested parties could present their arguments, was held.\n\nThe state won that hearing, and a groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for Oct. 7, 2014.\n\nThe groundbreaking was never intended to be a public event, said Bob McClaren, associate director of the University of Hawaii\u2019s Institute for Astronomy, which is responsible for scientific activities on the mountain.\n\n\u201cI thought it was reasonable to restrict access to those who were invited,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mangauil, who makes his living teaching hula dancing and Hawaiian culture, said later that he had wanted only to make the astronomers feel uncomfortable to be on the mountain and to get protesters\u2019 signs in view of the television cameras.\n\nIn an interview, he said he had nothing against science or astronomy, but did not want it on his mountain.\n\n\u201cOur connection to the mountain is like, that\u2019s our elder, the mother of our resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the wau akua, the realm of where the gods live.\u201d\n\nThere are no shrines on the very summit, he pointed out, which should be a lesson: Not even the most holy people are supposed to go there.\n\nUnable to get to the groundbreaking, the Hawaiians formed their own blockade. Tempers flared.\n\n\u201cWe were seeing the native Hawaiian movement flexing its muscles,\u201d Dr. Bolte said.\n\nSeeing people hiking up the mountain past the port-o-potties, Mr. Mangauil stormed after them and wound up on the hood of a ranger truck, even more angry.\n\nLanakila\u2019s barefoot run set the tone for two years of unrest and demonstrations.\n\nProtesters calling themselves Guardians of the Mountain set up a permanent vigil across the road from the Mauna Kea visitor center, stopping telescope construction crews and equipment from going up. Dozens were arrested.\n\nGov. David Ige has tried to appease both sides. While saying that \u201cwe have in many ways failed the mountain,\u201d he said the Thirty Meter Telescope should go forward, but at least three other telescopes would have to come down.\n\nAstronomers and business leaders grew frustrated that the state was not doing enough to keep the road open for construction trucks and workers.\n\n\u201cThe result of the faulty law enforcement surrounding Mauna Kea is fostering tension, aggression, racism and business uncertainty,\u201d business organizations and the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce wrote to the governor. \u201cAmbiguity surrounding the rule of law has prompted a poor economic climate.\u201d\n\nStopping trucks on the steep slope was dangerous, said Dr. Bolte, adding that \u201cpeople were basically trapped at the summit.\u201d\n\nDr. Simons, the Canada-France-Hawaii director, grew increasingly worried about the effect of the protests on the astronomers, who became reluctant to be identified as observatory staffers.\n\n\u201cIt really tugged at us to see the staff going from being proud to scared in a matter of weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile Ms. Pisciotta\u2018s coalition was plugging through the courts.\n\nOn Dec. 2, the Hawaiian Supreme Court revoked the telescope building permit, ruling that the state had violated due process by handing out the permit before the contested case hearing.\n\n\u201cQuite simply, the Board put the cart before the horse when it issued the permit,\u201d the court wrote.\n\nBy mid-December, Clarence Ching, another member of the opposition, stood in a crowd with other Hawaiians and watched trucks carrying equipment retreat from the mountain.\n\n\u201cDavid had beaten Goliath,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were even happy and sad at the same time \u2014 sad, for instance, that somebody had to lose \u2014 as we had fought hard and long.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision set the stage for a new round of hearings, now scheduled to start in mid-October. The case, presided over by Riki May Amano, a retired judge appointed by the Land Board, is likely to last longer than the first round, which consumed seven days of hearings over a few weeks, partly because there are more parties this time around.\n\nAmong them is the pro-telescope Hawaiian group called Perpetuating Unique Educational Opportunities or PUEO, who contend the benefits of the TMT to the community have been undersold.\n\nWhoever wins this fall\u2019s contested case hearing, the decision is sure to be quickly appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court.\n\nIn an interview, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and vice president of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, the group that will build the telescope, set April 2018 as the deadline for beginning construction. Depending on how it goes in Hawaii or elsewhere, the telescope could be ready sometime in the last half of the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe need to start building this thing somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe still hope Hawaii will work,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we need is a timely permit, and we need access to the mountain once we have a permit.\u201d\n\nBut there is no guarantee that even if the astronomers succeed in court they will prevail on the mountain. In an email exchange, J. Douglas Ing, lawyer for the TMT Observatory, said they were \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that local agencies would uphold the law, but the astronomers have also been investigating alternative sites in Mexico, Chile, India, China and the Canary Islands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wise of the TMT to be exploring other sites,\u201d said Richard Wurdeman, the lawyer for the Mauna Kea Hui.\n\nI asked Ms. Pisciotta what would happen if the giant telescope finally wins.\n\n\u201cIt would be really hard for Hawaiian people to swallow that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been our way to lift our prayers up to heaven and hope they hear us.\u201d\n\nDr. Bolte said he had learned to not make predictions about Hawaii.\n\nIn a recent email, he recalled photographing a bunch of short-eared Hawaiian owls. \u201cThese are called pueo, and they are said to be the physical form of ancestor spirits,\u201d Dr. Bolte recounted.\n\nReferring to the Hawaiian term for a wise elder, he said, \u201cI had one kupuna tell me it was a great sign for TMT that so many pueo sought me out that trip, and another tell me it was a sign that we should leave the island immediately before a calamity falls on TMT.\u201d\n", "control undoing climate trump office rules house taking completed littleknown effect regulations environmental legacy president white obamas options reverse": "\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump has vowed to dismantle many of the signature policies put in place by the Obama administration to fight the effects of climate change.\n\nDuring the campaign, he threatened, among other things, to kill the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules to reduce emissions from power plants. He has also taken aim at new regulations to limit methane leaks from wells and pipelines. And members of his transition team have suggested that he may reduce or eliminate basic climate research at NASA or other agencies.\n\nIf he follows through, most of these moves will be opposed by environmental groups, by Democrats in Congress and perhaps even by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump will have several tools to begin nullifying the Obama climate agenda.\n\nOne of them is the little-known Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a small outpost within the executive branch that has, since the Clinton administration, been the last stop for many regulations before they go into effect.\n\nLawyers in the office pore over thousands of pages of federal regulations daily and pride themselves on meticulously reviewing the fine print, even if that takes months or years.\n\nUnder the control of the new administration, the office could slow President Obama\u2019s latest regulatory initiatives by repeatedly sending them back for additional work.\n\n\u201cIt has been a brake on agency regulation throughout its lifetime,\u201d said Jody Freeman, a professor at Harvard Law School and an expert on environmental regulation. \u201cSome presidents have used it as more of a brake than others.\u201d\n\nMuch remains to be learned about the president-elect\u2019s environmental policy goals, and some of his views appear to have shifted.\n\nMr. Trump, who has claimed that global warming is a hoax, said this week in an interview with The New York Times that he now saw \u201csome connectivity\u201d between humans and climate change, and that he would \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d about whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as he threatened to do during the campaign.\n\nYet at the same time, some key positions on his transition team are occupied by people with a long history of rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nOther than climate change, there are numerous environmental issues that he has never talked about and that he might be content to leave untouched. And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or by his advisers. Two people considered to be in the running to head the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an energy lobbyist, and Robert E. Grady, a venture capitalist \u2014 also have experience in the complex machinations of the federal government.\n\n\u201cEvery new administration comes in with an overestimation of what it can accomplish and how quickly it can accomplish it,\u201d said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, a Washington law firm.\n\nIf Mr. Trump does decide to withdraw from the Paris agreement, he will find it difficult: The accord went into force this month. He would also encounter tremendous obstacles were he to try to dismantle the E.P.A., another campaign threat.\n\nBut he may have an easier time abandoning other climate initiatives, including a United Nations-backed program to reduce the environmental impact of international air travel beginning in 2020. The United States has only informally committed to participate in the program, and the new administration could refuse to make that commitment legally binding.\n\nOne of the most powerful methods to hobble Mr. Obama\u2019s domestic environmental initiatives would be to block financing for the E.P.A. and other agencies.\n\n\u201cCongress can always pass an appropriations rider that for one year prevents any funding for the implementation or enforcement of a particular regulation,\u201d said Scott H. Segal, a partner and director of the policy resolution group at Bracewell. Riders can be passed year after year, effectively neutering a specific regulation, Mr. Segal said.\n\nSuch an approach can be \u201cstealthier\u201d than trying to undo the regulation itself, Professor Freeman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to repeal these statutes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to make it impossible to implement them.\u201d\n\nAnother opening for Mr. Trump lies in regulations that were proposed by the Obama administration but are still technically \u201cin motion.\u201d In theory, he could pull back or block these rules.\n\nBut a departing administration can also use a regulation\u2019s \u201cin motion\u201d status to its own advantage. Last week, the Obama administration banned drilling in the Alaskan Arctic under the Interior Department\u2019s proposed five-year plan regulating oil and gas leases. Republicans could kill the plan. But to do so would mean crafting a replacement, a process that could take two years or more.\n\nLast week, the White House unveiled a sweeping plan to try to stiffen environmental regulations before Mr. Obama leaves office. Environmental groups can be expected to fight any efforts to undo them.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump can\u2019t just snap his fingers and change climate policy,\u201d said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cWe have ways to thwart him in Congress and the courts that we could employ.\u201d\n\nThe approach the Trump administration takes will depend in part on the status of specific rules and regulations.\n\nSome environmental policies \u2014 like \u201cguidance\u201d issued by the White House earlier this year, instructing agencies to consider the effects of climate change when conducting environmental reviews \u2014 do not have the force of law that agency regulations do, and can be abolished with a pen stroke. Undoing a regulation is more complicated. Some of the E.P.A.\u2019s new methane rules are completed, for example, but other rules, both at the E.P.A. and at the Interior Department, are not and can simply be abandoned.\n\nIf a rule is final, the options are different. The new administration cannot just rescind these regulations, but it can order agencies to revisit them. That reopens the rule-making process, however, including the opportunity for public comment. Any revisions or replacement regulations must have a basis in facts and a cost-benefit analysis, not politics or ideology.\n\nThere are other potential options for specific regulations. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, is completed but not yet in effect because of a judicial stay imposed while legal action against it plays out in a federal appeals court in Washington. If there is no ruling by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, Mr. Trump\u2019s Justice Department can ask the court to put the case in abeyance, effectively extending the stay indefinitely.\n\n\u201cIn some respects, this is in the Department of Justice\u2019s hands,\u201d said Tom Lorenzen, a lawyer at Crowell & Moring who argued against the plan before the appeals court. \u201cThey will make a determination of how they want to proceed.\u201d\n\nMr. Segal said the Republican Congress might also be able to overturn some recently completed regulations under a law that gives both houses up to 60 legislative days to reject them. That law, the Congressional Review Act, usually comes into play only when the party of the incoming president is different from the departing one\u2019s and the same party controls both houses, as is the case now.\n\nWilliam K. Reilly, a Republican who was E.P.A. administrator under President George Bush, said Mr. Trump needed to be careful about whom he picked for the top jobs in each department.\n\nHe cited the Reagan administration\u2019s experience with Anne Gorsuch, who incurred the wrath of politicians of both parties when, as administrator of the E.P.A., she cut the agency\u2019s budget by more than 20 percent, gutting research and regulatory enforcement. She resigned under fire in 1983 in the midst of accusations that she had mismanaged a hazardous waste cleanup program.\n\n\u201cThe administration got badly burned by discounting the sensitivities and public support for what the E.P.A. protects us from,\u201d Mr. Reilly said. \u201cIt\u2019s a public health agency above all.\u201d\n", "participated asteroid rehearse agencies month angeles los nasa strike earth simulation unthinkable fema crashing": "\nImagine if scientists discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Los Angeles.\n\nThe possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a 330-foot asteroid hitting the Earth.\n\nThe simulation projected a worst-case blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties.\n\nIn 1998, the movie \u201cArmageddon\u201d dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: \u201cThe United States government just asked us to save the world.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA\u2019s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in an email.\n\nThe center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory.\n\nThe center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, \u201cbut none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,\u201d Mr. Chodas said.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,\u201d he added.\n\nThat\u2019s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif., comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy\u2019s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nWhile a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said.\n\n\u201cEngineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid\u201d years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said.\n\nIt could take up to two years to build such a \u201ckinetic impactor\u201d spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a \u201cdeflection mission,\u201d was necessary.\n\nFor the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world.\n\nThe group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the \u201c100x Declaration,\u201d which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100,000 per year in the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,\u201d Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group\u2019s website.\n\nAsteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest space-related explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908.\n\nAn asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a medium-size hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nWhile there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\nIn more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1,000 people.\n\nScientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more Chelyabinsk-size space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought.\n\nPredictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth.\n\nIn a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth.\n\nThe agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth \u201cwithout incident \u2014 just as NASA said they would.\u201d\n", "giants streak short end zone passes sixgame touchdowns half winning roethlisberger dismal pick ben struggled threw red steelers": "\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 And so the questions will begin: Are the Giants not what they seemed to be during their six-game winning streak, which expired unceremoniously in Pittsburgh on Sunday?\n\nThe Giants had been trouncing mostly laggards lately. On Sunday, when the level of opposition ramped up a notch, the Giants collapsed in a clumsy 24-14 loss to the Steelers. A bad day for the Giants (8-4) turned worse after the final whistle, when the team\u2019s best player, wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., suggested that the game\u2019s officials had been so one-sided that they should not be allowed to work Giants games.\n\nBeckham has been in the midst of several other firestorms in his brief N.F.L. career, and he was joined in a brewing tempest by his usually placid fellow receiver Victor Cruz, who did not have a pass thrown in his direction all day. An upset Cruz wanted an explanation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to somebody,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to give me an answer as to why.\u201d\n\nOn the injury front, the Giants\u2019 best defender, Jason Pierre-Paul, left the game in the first half with a groin injury and did not return to play.\n\nWith all this, the Giants\u2019 late-season quest for a playoff berth has become even more arduous. Arriving at MetLife Stadium for the next game will be the Dallas Cowboys, who, at 11-1, have the N.F.L.\u2019s best record.\n\nBen McAdoo, the Giants\u2019 first-year coach, did not appear rattled. He has often referred to his job leading this year\u2019s young Giants as \u201cputting out Dumpster fires.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday he said: \u201cWe are who we are right now. I\u2019m not worried; we\u2019ve just got to put work into it.\u201d\n\nThe video of the Pittsburgh game will be a good tutorial in the Giants\u2019 weaknesses, because the Steelers (7-5) vividly exposed a few.\n\nOver and over on Sunday, Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger held the football behind the line of scrimmage waiting for a receiver to break open. He saw that the Giants\u2019 secondary was devoting several defenders to cover the Steelers\u2019 fleet wide receivers deep down the field.\n\nWaiting in the passing pocket, Roethlisberger must have been wearing a Cheshire cat\u2019s grin. He had the perfect countermove for the Giants\u2019 defensive strategy.\n\nFrom the first play of the game, Roethlisberger seemed more than happy to flick short passes and create mismatches that revealed the inadequate coverage skills of the Giants\u2019 linebackers. The team\u2019s previously reliable safeties were victimized as well.\n\nThe Steelers never trailed in the game, and the Pittsburgh tight ends and running backs combined for more than 206 receiving yards. Roethlisberger, who completed 24 of 36 passes for 289 yards and two touchdowns, spent most of the game targeting the middle of the field to avoid the Giants\u2019 elite cornerback, Janoris Jenkins. Poor Giants tackling aided the Steelers\u2019 cause.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 offensive unit, which at times advanced up and down the field effectively, notably failed twice to get the football into the end zone despite being inside the Steelers\u2019 20-yard line.\n\n\u201cGetting no points in those situations can really come back to haunt you,\u201d said Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who completed 24 of 39 passes but had two interceptions to match his two touchdowns. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing pretty well in those situations lately.\u201d\n\nBut that was during the winning streak, and against lesser opponents.\n\nThe Giants trailed by 14-0 after a dismal first half but showed some life early in the third quarter, when Manning became intent on getting the ball to Beckham, who had only one pass thrown in his direction in the first half. Three Beckham receptions and an 18-yard run by the rookie Paul Perkins helped the Giants advance to the Steelers\u2019 3-yard line, where they faced a fourth-and-1.\n\nManning threw to tight end Will Tye, who appeared to be hit from behind before the ball reached him. The pass fell incomplete, and a promising Giants drive ended with the team still looking for its first points of the game.\n\nOn the next Pittsburgh possession, however, Steelers running back Le\u2019Veon Bell fumbled. Giants running back Rashad Jennings later caught a screen pass and ran 13 yards into the end zone to cut the Pittsburgh lead to 14-7.\n\nBut it took Roethlisberger little time to exploit the Giants\u2019 defensive weaknesses again. With a pump fake, he tricked safety Landon Collins and threw to tight end Ladarius Green for a 20-yard touchdown that restored Pittsburgh\u2019s 14-point lead. Green had 110 receiving yards on six catches.\n\nTwo Giants drives later, Manning was intercepted as he heaved a desperate fourth-down pass on the run after scrambling out of the pocket. Another crushing Manning interception came as the Giants were trying to score from the Steelers\u2019 9-yard line, although in that case and in many instances, Manning was under pressure from the Pittsburgh defensive line.\n\nThe Steelers tacked on a field goal in the fourth quarter, and the Giants also scored in the game\u2019s final minute on a 1-yard reception by Sterling Shepard.\n\n\u201cThings will jell, and it will all click at some point,\u201d Beckham said. Then, looking ahead to Dallas, he added, \u201cIt just needs to be very soon with the team we have coming in, because they are red hot.\u201d\n", "duty injured dozen visiting military hospital inspired times visited affected reed sacred president wounded obama trips walter": "\nBETHESDA, Md. \u2014 President Obama stood outside the room, rubbed sanitizer on his hands, set his face into a smile and knocked on the door.\n\nNo one answered. He looked at the hospital floor, polished to a sheen, and knocked again. Still no answer. So Mr. Obama turned the knob and gently pushed his way inside.\n\n\u201cHello? Jeremy, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Maj. Jeremy Haynes remembers the president saying as he came into his room at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center two years ago.\n\nIt was the first of several visits the president paid Major Haynes, an Army officer who was told he would never walk, feel below his waist or have children again after his spine was hit by a Taliban bullet in Afghanistan. The visits, Major Haynes said, \u201cwere truly inspiring to me\u201d and gave him hope for the life ahead of him.\n\nOn Tuesday, for his 23rd and probably last time as president, Mr. Obama traveled to the military hospital to spend an afternoon with the wounded from Afghanistan and Iraq. Because of the weather, he arrived in a motorcade, not his usual helicopter, but otherwise, his visit unfolded much as Major Haynes and hospital officials describe the ones he has paid before.\n\nWith a minimum of ceremony, the president\u2019s motorcade pulled up to a side entrance, where a military aide met him with the latest update on the conditions of those he was about to see. He then climbed four flights of stairs to 4 West and 4 Center, known as the soldiers ward. After greeting the doctors and nurses on duty, he began his rounds, eventually meeting 13 soldiers and awarding 12 Purple Hearts.\n\nFor Mr. Obama, who has served as a wartime commander longer than any of his predecessors, meeting with the wounded and their families is among the most sacred duties of his presidency. He rarely talks about his trips to Walter Reed, but his aides say they have affected him deeply.\n\nDavid Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s longtime political aide, said the president often returned from Walter Reed, first when it was in Washington and later after it had merged with Bethesda Naval Hospital, in a somber mood. After one trip, he recalled, Mr. Obama described a young woman attending to her newlywed husband, whose body was shattered and head terribly wounded.\n\n\u201c\u2018You want to be upbeat and encouraging,\u2019 I remember him saying,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. \u201c\u2018But they\u2019re just kids starting out, and I looked at his wife\u2019s face, and you could see her struggling with what this would mean for the rest of their lives. It\u2019s really hard.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his first two years in office, as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan raged and there were many wounded, Mr. Obama\u2019s trips to Walter Reed were three- and four-hour slogs during which he donned fresh hospital gowns and gloves outside every fifth room to see patients clinging to life days or weeks after being blown apart. He returned to the White House visibly drained, aides said.\n\nMore recently, he has done push-ups and other exercises with newly minted civilians who, instead of struggling to live, are trying to find ways of coping without arms, legs or equilibrium months and years after being wounded.\n\n\u201cThe first term, our visits would last for hours because there would be 25, 50, 75 folks that we\u2019d be seeing, going room to room, many with devastating injuries,\u201d Michelle Obama, who has made her own trips to Walter Reed, said recently. \u201cAnd now, today, just last week he went to visit, and he was there for 30 minutes because there are fewer of our men and women who are being injured in war.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon excursions from the White House have served in many ways as the counterpoint to Mr. Obama\u2019s 15 trips offering condolences after mass shootings, when he has openly grieved with families, tears on his face. At Walter Reed, his goal has been to thank and uplift the wounded and their families, whose sacrifices he sees as almost holy, and among whom expressions of grief are often unwelcome.\n\n\u201cIf you are coming into this room with sorrow or to feel sorry for my wounds, go elsewhere,\u201d read one handwritten sign outside a soldier\u2019s door, now framed and installed on the soldiers ward.\n\nReggie Love, a former aide to Mr. Obama who accompanied him on nearly all of his trips to military hospitals in the first three years of his administration, said the president was good at reading the rooms he entered. Not everyone wanted an upbeat message.\n\n\u201cSometimes the people he met didn\u2019t have any questions for him or really anything to say,\u201d Mr. Love said. \u201cSometimes they just needed a hug.\u201d\n\nSome of the soldiers Mr. Obama has visited are more grievously wounded than those seen by any modern president, as improved technology has saved people who even five years ago would have died on the battlefield. The shock of repeatedly seeing such devastating injuries can affect someone\u2019s psyche far more than flag-draped coffins, psychologists say.\n\n\u201cEvery time I visit Walter Reed, every time I visit Bethesda, I\u2019m reminded of the wages of war,\u201d Mr. Obama said at Fort Campbell, Ky., in 2011.\n\nRobert M. Gates, the former defense secretary, wrote in his memoir \u201cDuty\u201d that seeing the wounded and attending funerals took such an emotional toll that he had to resign. Critics see another effect. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Obama has become increasingly unwilling to commit troops to wars in places like Libya, Syria and Iraq.\n\nEliot A. Cohen, an official in the George W. Bush administration who is now a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, said that Mr. Obama\u2019s trips to Walter Reed may have been the reason, and that future presidents should avoid such visits.\n\n\u201cA president has to be psychologically prepared to send people into harm\u2019s way and to get a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cAnd anything they do that might cripple them that way means they\u2019re not doing their job.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has rejected such criticism, saying his rounds at Walter Reed have highlighted the risks of war but have not stopped him from ordering troops into battle when needed.\n\nHis message to the wounded is always the same.\n\n\u201cHe walked in and said: \u2018Tim, thank you for what you\u2019ve done. I appreciate your sacrifice, and the country is indebted to you,\u2019\u201d said Timothy Payne, who stepped on a bomb in Afghanistan in 2011 and lost both legs. \u201cAnd then he shook my hand and gave me one of those presidential coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then he said, \u2018What happened?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, I got blown up,\u2019 and we both laughed,\u201d Mr. Payne said.\n\nSpouses, parents and children are often present, and Mr. Obama always addresses them by their first names. He sometimes hugs wives, but if a mother is there, he invariably says, \u201cAnd moms get hugs,\u201d and embraces her.\n\nAfter the greetings, Mr. Obama sometimes calls in a military aide so he can award a Purple Heart or other citation. He asks if they have any questions or concerns and calls in another aide to take notes and follow through. The most common question deals with retiring from active duty, a laborious and often frustrating process for the wounded.\n\nThe visits end with Mr. Obama signing unit flags, books and anything else presented to him, and with a photographer taking group and paired shots. Sometimes families ask to have photos taken with their own phones, which Mr. Obama hands to his photographer.\n\nIn June, Mr. Obama visited the hospital\u2019s physical therapy room, where amputees learn to walk again. One double-amputee gave him a push-up challenge, and Mr. Obama promptly shed his suit jacket, dropped to the floor and reeled off more than 20. Still wearing dress shoes, he joined another in jumping onto a 30-inch box.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even put into words how impressed I was,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. John Terry, known as Jae, an amputee whose photo of himself doing lunges with Mr. Obama is among his most treasured possessions. \u201cI will remember that day until I die.\u201d\n\nNot every severely wounded patient at Walter Reed meets the president. Some miss him by chance. A few refuse because they disagree with his politics.\n\nBut even some of the president\u2019s critics say his presence ennobled their injuries and made them feel part of a larger plan.\n\nAs he buckled his two stumps into prosthetic legs at the hospital one day recently, Edward Klein, known as Flip, a retired Army major, acknowledged, \u201cI wasn\u2019t a big fan of his politically.\u201d\n\nBut he added, \u201cMeeting the president added a feeling of legitimacy and recognition for what I did.\u201d\n", "insert set group mimosas twinkle fewer names stars published international astronomy approved hd": "\nWhich branch of science has the worst trouble with names?\n\nYou might think it\u2019s physics, which has bestowed whimsical-sounding names like quarks, neutrinos, selectrons and bosons on the most elemental constituents of nature.\n\nBut in astronomy the confusion can be well, cosmic.\n\nWhere would we be without the North Star, also known as Polaris, Alpha Ursae Minoris, HD 8890 and a host of other names including (in Inuit) Niiqirtsuituq?\n\nThe stars are our oldest promise of order in the universe and the most profound symbols of our possible destiny.\n\nBut only a relative handful of the billions of twinkling lights in the sky have names, misspelled and mistranslated as they have been handed down through the ages in a variety of cultures, recognizable to the average adult who probably lives in a city and can\u2019t see many of the stars anyway. Still more stars have designations using Greek letters to rank them by brightness within their constellations, but constellations have arbitrary and shifting boundaries, and are culture-specific anyway.\n\nAll stars do have numbers. In fact, many have more than one number, corresponding to their listings in the voluminous catalogs that have been compiled over the century by astronomers. The PPMXL catalog, combining data from the United States Naval Observatory and the University of Massachusetts, lists the positions and motions of some 900 million stars.\n\nThis makes for awkward moments when modern astrophysics vaults one of these previously anonymous stars into the limelight, because it is exploding weirdly or turns out to harbor possibly habitable planets. Such dramatic destinations as HR 8799 , HD 85512 and Gliese 581 don\u2019t exactly trip off the tongue.\n\nNow, however, the International Astronomical Union, an organization of stargazers, is coming to the rescue. In November, it published what it calls \u201cthe first set\u201d of approved names for 227 stars.\n\nThe I.A.U. has traditionally concerned itself with policing the names of asteroids, craters and comets, and famously demoting Pluto from full-planet status 10 years ago. It is also worth reminding readers here that the IAU\u2019s hegemony is absolute and cosmic; no amount of money donated to a registry or anywhere else will get your name officially on a star. Nevermind the engraved certificate that comes along with it.\n\nThe problem of star names came up in 2015 when the astronomical union ran a contest to name some of the new planets that were being discovered in droves around other stars by NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft and ground-based astronomers.\n\nThe game included names for the stars around which those new worlds were orbiting. It turned out that some already had names, albeit not ones that were well known, even to the professionals: Edasich, for example, an orange star in Draco, the Dragon, whose name derives from an Arabic term for \u201cmale hyena.\u201d\n\nOr Ain, Arabic for \u201ceye,\u201d an orange giant star in Taurus, the bull.\n\nShould they overwrite these names by popular vote or give them new life? The committee opted for tradition.\n\nThe result was the formation of a new I.A.U. committee, the Working Group on Star Names. Eric Mamajek of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the chairman of the group, said its main priorities so far have been collecting star names from the scientific literature and astronomical cultures around the world.\n\nThe new list is the first fruit of their efforts. How far it goes will depend on how interested the international community is in having a mechanism for naming interesting objects, Dr. Mamajek said, noting that planetary astronomers have had committees for naming craters, asteroids and such for decades \u201cwith only minor hiccups.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alternative is chaos,\u201d he added.\n\nThe first list contains the most well-known stars, and their inclusion will prevent the names from being used for something else, like an asteroid or an exoplanet, Dr. Mamajek said.\n\nTheir names go back as far as the Arab astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in the 10th century, but the words have been Latinized and misspelled over the years.\n\nDr. Mamajek said he had found 30 versions of the star Fomalhaut in astronomical literature.\n\nSirius, the brightest star of all to the eye, just now making its presence known in the winter sky, also goes by the names of the Dog Star, Aschere, Canicula, Al Shira, Sothis, Alhabor, Mrgavyadha, Lubdhaka and Tenr\u014dsei,as well as Alpha Canis Majoris, after its constellation, Canis Major, the big dog.\n\nNot all the names on the new list are so familiar. I never knew there was a star named Musica. Or Mimosa, the second brightest star in the Southern Cross, or Crux. Just saying the name made me want to drink one, -settle into a hammock and gaze up at the constellation.\n\nI would love to find out someday that somebody or something lives there, calling those blissful sounding rays home.\n", "tickets wellestablished competitor ticketing fandango movie user atom startup face increase base heavyweights seeks seats hopes advised hollywood empty fill": "\nSANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 As anyone who has been to a movie theater knows, a lot of seats are usually empty. Add up those empties over the course of a year, according to Atom Tickets, a start-up based here, and more than 5 billion seats go unsold annually at North American multiplexes.\n\nHow can theaters fill just 1 percent of that inventory, resulting in hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in added box office and concessions revenue?\n\nAtom, a movie ticketing app and website, has made solving that puzzle its mission \u2014 and, as it seeks to increase its user base over the busy holiday film season, it has secured backing from three Hollywood heavyweights: J. J. Abrams, Tyler Perry and Steven Spielberg. The men have agreed to join Atom\u2019s advisory board. Mr. Abrams and Mr. Perry are also stakeholders; Atom would not say whether Mr. Spielberg had become an investor.\n\nAtom, incubated by Lions Gate Entertainment, where the vice chairman Michael Burns has been a crucial supporter, makes it easy for groups of people \u2014 particularly those glued to their smartphones \u2014 to plan film outings. \u201cOur hopes are that Atom Tickets triggers a social moviegoing revolution,\u201d Mr. Spielberg said in a statement. \u201cThis is a big win for anyone who loves going to the movies with his or her friends.\u201d\n\nMr. Perry, speaking by phone on Saturday, added, \u201cI\u2019m excited about this because I think it allows my audience to have a better moviegoing experience \u2014 easier, more social.\u201d\n\nMr. Abrams compared Atom to other breakthrough technology companies. \u201cIt\u2019s like before there was Uber,\u201d he said by phone on Friday. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know how badly you needed it. When I started using the Atom app, I wished I had it earlier. I couldn\u2019t believe this didn\u2019t already exist. But there is nothing else like it.\u201d\n\nEven with its new pitchmen, Atom faces an entrenched competitor in Fandango, which NBCUniversal owns. Fandango, known for its playful marketing campaigns, has been the longtime leader in online movie ticketing and continues to grow, in part by embedding its ticket-selling technology into Facebook and Snapchat feeds. Fandango, which services about 28,000 domestic movie screens, is also focused on international growth.\n\nBut Atom, only a few months old, has already proved to be a serious competitor. It services about 15,000 screens in North America, with thousands more coming online in the months ahead. \u201cBy this time next year, we will have mopped up most of the rest,\u201d said Ameesh Paleja, Atom\u2019s chief executive. (There are about 43,000 domestic movie screens in total.)\n\nPart of Atom\u2019s appeal involves its polished app, which allows users to quickly spin through a wheel of movie posters representing current and coming releases. Using \u201cpredictive analytics\u201d \u2014 jargon for a Netflix-style recommendation system \u2014 Atom suggests movie tickets based on previous orders and information gleaned from linked social network accounts. (If you follow Casey Affleck on Facebook, for instance, Atom may suggest tickets to his latest film, \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe market needed shaking up,\u201d said Matthew Bakal, Atom\u2019s chairman, noting that even Universal Pictures, a corporate cousin to Fandango, recently contacted Atom to discuss a potential promotional partnership.\n\nAtom, which has $60 million in funding from Lions Gate, 20th Century Fox and Disney, also learns which theaters users tend to frequent and with whom, allowing people to easily extend digital invitations to friends and family members for future group outings. Because Atom facilitates payment splitting among multiple people, \u201cone poor goat isn\u2019t stuck buying tickets for everyone,\u201d as Mr. Paleja put it.\n\nThe start-up has also made group discounts, particularly for less popular showtimes, part of its mission, along with concession stand pre-orders. Merchandise is another component. Starting last week, anyone using Atom to buy tickets to \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story,\u201d set for release by Disney on Dec. 16, could also buy exclusive products tied to the film, including sweatshirts and T-shirts. Down the road, Atom plans to sell toys, music and games related to various films.\n\nFree to download, Atom collects a surcharge on ticket sales. Studios can also hire it to promote certain films.\n\nHollywood could use the help. As entertainment options have proliferated, theater admissions in North America, despite a growing population, have been roughly flat. Last year, 1.32 billion tickets were sold in the United States and Canada, a bit up from the year before, but down from the 10-year high of 1.42 billion in 2009, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nAtom had hoped that its app would result in a 2 to 5 percent increase in ticket sales and concession orders for its theater partners. Early results indicate that some theaters have instead seen \u201cdouble-digit percentage growth,\u201d Mr. Bakal said. More than 80 percent of Atom users are 18 to 39.\n\nMr. Paleja, who previously worked at Amazon, where he helped introduce Prime Instant Video, said he hopes that the megaphones offered by Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Abrams and Mr. Perry will result in more growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the new guys on the block,\u201d he said, \u201cand they give us legitimacy.\u201d\n", "man climate obamas takes found trump contrarian dismantle myron change donald trumps policies ebell president mr presidentelect vowed epa": "\nThe mug-shot posters, pasted on walls and lampposts around Paris by an activist group during the United Nations climate talks last year, were hardly flattering. They depicted Myron Ebell, a climate contrarian, as one of seven \u201cclimate criminals\u201d wanted for \u201cdestroying our future.\u201d\n\nBut in his customary mild-mannered way, Mr. Ebell, who directs environmental and energy policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group in Washington, brushed it off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to this over the years,\u201d he told an interviewer at the talks. \u201cBut I did go out and get my photo taken with my poster, just so I have it as a memento.\u201d\n\nIn looking for someone to follow through on his campaign vow to dismantle one of the Obama administration\u2019s signature climate change policies, President-elect Donald J. Trump probably could not have found a better candidate for the job than Mr. Ebell.\n\nMr. Ebell, who revels in taking on the scientific consensus on global warming, will be Mr. Trump\u2019s lead agent in choosing personnel and setting the direction of the federal agencies that address climate change and environmental policy more broadly.\n\nMr. Ebell, whose organization is financed in part by the coal industry, has been one of the most vocal opponents of the linchpin of that policy, the Clean Power Plan. Developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the plan is a far-reaching set of regulations that, by seeking to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation, could result in the closing of many coal-burning power plants, among other effects.\n\nMr. Ebell has said that the plan, which has been tied up in the courts since it was finalized in 2015, is illegal. In the interview in Paris last year, he said he hoped whoever was elected president would \u201cundo the E.P.A. power plant regs and some of the other regs that are very harmful to our economy.\u201d\n\nAs the person Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the transition at the E.P.A., Mr. Ebell, 63, will be in a position to begin to do just that.\n\nMr. Ebell, who did not respond to a request for an interview, grew up on a ranch in Oregon. He got his undergraduate degree at Colorado College and master\u2019s at the London School of Economics, where he studied under the conservative political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. He has described himself as \u201csort of a contrarian by nature and upbringing,\u201d and has said he was very strongly influenced by the \u201cquestion authority\u201d ethos of 1960s and \u201970s counterculture\n\n\u201cI really think that people should be suspicious of authority,\u201d he told an interviewer last year. \u201cThe more you\u2019re told that you have to believe something, the more you should question it.\u201d\n\nMr. Ebell leads the Cooler Heads Coalition, a loose-knit group that says it is \u201cfocused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis.\u201d He has been one of the nation\u2019s most visible climate contrarians, known for dispensing memorable sound bites on cable news shows and at events like the annual conferences sponsored by the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based group that rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nMr. Ebell has said that \u201ca lot of third-, fourth- and fifth-rate scientists have gotten a long ways\u201d by embracing climate change. He frequently mocks climate leaders like Al Gore, and has called the movement the \u201cforces of darkness\u201d because \u201cthey want to turn off the lights all over the world.\u201d\n\nNo one, it seems, is immune to his criticism. He called Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical on climate change, issued in mid-2015, \u201cscientifically ill informed, economically illiterate, intellectually incoherent and morally obtuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also theologically suspect, and large parts of it are leftist drivel,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Ebell cut his teeth in Washington working for Frontiers of Freedom, a research group founded by former Senator Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, to advocate for limited government. He also worked for a Republican congressman from Arizona, John Shadegg, on an effort to revamp the Endangered Species Act to make it more respectful of property rights.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Mr. Ebell comes off as amiable and calm. But he is hardly shy about lobbing verbal grenades, sometimes directly at scientists and environmentalists.\n\nHe clashed with Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in an appearance on Fox News in 2009 after the unauthorized release of emails from a server at an English university set off a battle over the integrity of leading climate scientists.\n\nMr. Ebell called Dr. Trenberth \u201cpart of a gang\u201d that had been \u201ccooking the data\u201d on climate for years, accusations that Dr. Trenberth strenuously denied.\n\nDuring an August 2015 appearance on C-Span with Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Defense Fund, Mr. Ebell did not deny Mr. Symons\u2019 assertion that the Competitive Enterprise Institute receives money from the Murray Energy Corporation, one of the nation\u2019s largest coal producers. He countered that his group\u2019s total budget, of about $6 million, was far smaller than that of Mr. Symons\u2019 group.\n\n\u201cI would like to have more funding,\u201d Mr. Ebell said, \u201cso that I could combat the nonsense put out by the environmental movement.\u201d\n", "immunotherapy cancer drugs makes attack effective system breakthrough immune unleashed hailed treatment doctors finding poses organs therapies risks": "\nAs Chuck Peal lay in a Waterbury, Conn., emergency room one Sunday in early September, doctors furiously tried to make sense of his symptoms.

Mr. Peal\u2019s body was attacking itself, a severe reaction by his immune system that was a side effect of a seemingly miraculous cancer treatment aimed at saving his life.\n\nIn the seven weeks prior, doctors at Yale had combated Mr. Peal\u2019s melanoma with two of the most promising drugs in cancer treatment today. These medicines work by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer as ferociously as it does other threats, like viruses and bacteria.\n\nThese so-called immunotherapy drugs have been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer treatment, attracting billions of research dollars and offering new hope to patients out of options. But as their use grows, doctors are finding that they pose serious risks that stem from the very thing that makes them effective. An unleashed immune system can attack healthy, vital organs: notably the bowel, the liver and the lungs, but also the kidneys, the adrenal and pituitary glands, the pancreas and, in rare cases, the heart.\n\nDoctors at Yale believe immunotherapy is causing a new type of acute-onset diabetes, with at least 17 cases there so far, Mr. Peal\u2019s among them. In cancer clinics around the world, and in drug trials, myriad other side effects are showing up. Studies are finding that severe reactions occur nearly 20 percent of the time with certain drugs, and in more than half of patients when some drugs are used in combination.\n\nAnother recent paper found that 30 percent of patients experienced \u201cinteresting, rare or unexpected side effects,\u201d with a quarter of the reactions described as severe, life-threatening or requiring hospitalization. Some patients have died, including five in recent months in clinical trials of a new immunotherapy drug being tested by Juno Therapeutics Inc.\n\nThe upshot, oncologists and immunologists say, is that the medical field must be more vigilant as these drugs soar in popularity. And they say more research is needed into who is likely to have reactions and how to treat them.\n\n\u201cWe are playing with fire,\u201d said Dr. John Timmerman, an oncologist and immunotherapy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, who recently lost a patient to side effects. The woman\u2019s immunotherapy drugs had successfully \u201cmelted away\u201d her cancer, he said, but some weeks later, she got cold and flulike symptoms and died in the emergency room from an inflammatory response that Dr. Timmerman described as \u201ca mass riot, an uprising\u201d of her immune system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about immunotherapy as God\u2019s gift, the chosen elixir, the cure for cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard much about the collateral damage.\u201d\n\nDespite the warnings, physicians like Dr. Timmerman remain hugely supportive of drugs that are saving the lives of people who would otherwise die. Far better to cope with diabetes, hepatitis or arthritis, the thinking goes, than to die. Most reactions are not nearly so bad and are treatable.\n\nThe rub, doctors and researchers say, is that the medical system \u2014 from front-line nurses to oncologists to emergency rooms \u2014 is too often caught off guard. This is happening for a number of reasons: The drugs are new, so many side effects just have not been seen. Symptoms appear at random, sometimes months after treatment, and can initially seem innocuous. Finally, oncologists are now trying to treat patients with a combination of two or more immunotherapy drugs, hoping for more effective treatment but sometimes getting amplified risks.\n\nIn the meantime, these drugs are moving from academic centers into cancer clinics across the country, where oncologists in smaller cities most likely have less experience with the side effects.\n\nAnd with lives to be saved and billions of dollars to be made \u2014 $250,000 or more is the list price for a year of some regimens \u2014 not enough research has been done into the risks of the new therapies, said William Murphy, a professor of dermatology at the University of California, Davis, who reviews immunotherapy-related grants for the government.\n\nIt is \u201ca massively understudied area,\u201d Dr. Murphy said, adding: \u201cThe No. 1 priority is anti-tumor effects. Everything else, however severe, is considered the price worth paying.\u201d\n\nCaught in the middle are patients like Mr. Peal, whose stories show the delicacy of tinkering with the immune system. It may hold the keys to curing cancer if it can be at once stoked and tamed.\n\nMr. Peal, bespectacled and lean, was dealing with melanoma that had spread to his lungs in June 2015 when he saw a Yale oncologist, Dr. Harriet Kluger. In the past, a patient like him would have been given little chance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d sit the patient down and say, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, the median life expectancy is nine months. Get your affairs in order,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Kluger, who runs immunotherapy clinical trials focusing on skin and kidney cancer.\n\nNow she could offer Mr. Peal hope. Consider: One study co-authored by Dr. Kluger found positive responses in more than 40 percent of advanced melanoma patients when they used a combination of two major immunotherapy drugs, nivolumab and ipilimumab.\n\nOther research, however, shows that the promise comes with real risks. A 2015 paper in The New England Journal of Medicine showed that use of these drugs carried a risk of side effects that were severe, required hospitalization or were life-threatening 54 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s at least that high, at least,\u201d Dr. Kluger said. But, she noted, most of the side effects are manageable through immune suppression, such as with steroids.\n\nThe effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs and their side effects are intimately bound by the same biological mechanisms.\n\nCalled checkpoint inhibitors, the drugs work by essentially reversing a trick that cancer plays on the immune system: The cancer cells send nefarious signals to immune-system cells that cause them to stand down. Cancer is turning on the immune system\u2019s brake.\n\nThere is a valuable reason the brake exists: It can shut down the body\u2019s powerful defenders so that they do not inadvertently attack the body itself. Cancer is taking advantage of this key survival mechanism.\n\nWhen an immunotherapy drug turns the brake off, the immune system can sometimes shrink tumors in mere days.\n\nMr. Peal, an engineering technician who tests the performance of helicopter parts, started taking nivolumab and ipilimumab on July 8. Dr. Kluger told him he might feel drowsy or nauseated, or he could get a rash. A rash indeed struck with a vengeance on Aug. 30: red welts from his knees to his waist. On Sept. 1, a Thursday, he visited Dr. Kluger\u2019s office, where he was given a steroid.\n\nThe next day, he had a fever, nausea and was \u201cdying of thirst \u2014 like beyond being in the desert,\u201d he said. He threw up everything. His girlfriend, Jo-ann Keating, called Dr. Kluger\u2019s office, and an on-call doctor prescribed an antinausea drug. Later, Ms. Keating called back to say it was not working, and he was prescribed a second antinausea drug. By Sunday morning, Mr. Peal, unable to move, took an ambulance to the emergency room.\n\nIn his wallet, he kept an information card published by Bristol-Myers Squibb. It lists dozens of risks, including that the therapy \u201ccan cause serious side effects in many parts of your body, which can lead to death.\u201d Mr. Peal\u2019s family told the emergency room doctor about the treatment, Ms. Keating recalled.\n\n\u201cThe doctor kept on saying he was on chemotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018They\u2019re calling it immunotherapy.\u2019 He went on his phone and started looking for information.\u201d\n\nBut even Dr. Kluger\u2019s experienced team, which answered the distressed phone calls that weekend, was caught off guard and did not react immediately to the symptoms.\n\n\u201cIt took us by surprise. He looked absolutely fine on Friday,\u201d Dr. Kluger said. Part of the problem, she thinks, is that Mr. Peal was relatively new to the clinic, and so she and her staff members did not have the experience with him to accurately assess his symptoms. \u201cIt also happened very quickly. It spiraled within hours.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Mr. Peal spent 24 days in the hospital, where trouble mounted. First his pancreas failed, then his bowels inflamed and his kidneys became dysfunctional, and \u201cto top it off, he has a fever of 103 for which we can\u2019t find a source,\u201d Dr. Kluger said in an interview during the crisis. She was trying to figure it out and had emailed other experts around the country to see if they had ever had a patient with this combination of acute immune reactions. No one had seen it before.\n\nThe pancreas problem was particularly noteworthy. Mr. Peal\u2019s is among a growing number of such cases that have led a Yale endocrinologist, Dr. Kevan Herold, an authority on autoimmunity, to conclude that he is seeing a new form of Type 1 diabetes. Typically, the peak age of onset of Type 1 diabetes is 6 to 12, and it involves the immune system\u2019s destroying, bit by bit, the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin needed to metabolize sugar into energy.\n\nBut this is different: Patients are 50 or older and are losing insulin production all at once, including in one case of an 83-year-old. Dr. Herold said he was hearing similar stories from peers around the country. \u201cA single case like this is uncommon,\u201d he said. \u201cAs an aggregate, it\u2019s unheard-of.\u201d\n\nAnother case at Yale involved Colleen Platt, 65, a real estate agent from Torrington, Conn., who was being treated by Dr. Kluger for late-stage kidney cancer. Ms. Platt opted for a clinical trial involving two immunotherapy drugs, atezolizumab and a second drug that Dr. Kluger declined to name because the trial is continuing.\n\nDays after the second treatment in November 2014, Ms. Platt started feeling dizzy and numb and was vomiting water. She went to Dr. Kluger\u2019s office, where they did lab tests that \u201cwere so profoundly abnormal, we thought this was lab error,\u201d Dr. Kluger recounted. \u201cWe thought the machine was messed up.\u201d\n\nThe tests were right. Like Mr. Peal, Ms. Platt had gone into diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition in which her body, desperate to compensate for energy it was missing when her pancreas shut down, created a flux of acid that could keep her functioning in the short term, at the risk of gravely harming organs throughout her body. Outside the emergency room, while a chaplain visited Ms. Platt to comfort her, Dr. Kluger called the drug company to report the extraordinary reaction.\n\nToday, like Mr. Peal, Ms. Platt takes multiple insulin shots each day, and still her sugar level fluctuates wildly. On the other hand, immunotherapy has largely beaten her cancer. In fact, after consulting with other doctors and one of the drug companies, Dr. Kluger recommended Ms. Platt continue with treatment, which she did.\n\n\u201cHer pancreas isn\u2019t coming back,\u201d Dr. Kluger said, referring to the diabetic effects of immunotherapy. \u201cShe has her life.\u201d\n\nMr. Peal \u2014 who, like Ms. Platt, agreed to let Dr. Kluger and Dr. Herold discuss his case \u2014 feels the trade-off will be well worth it. In fact, on Friday, he got the results from a scan taken the day before and learned that immunotherapy had eliminated two of his cancer lesions and shrunk two others. \u201cI can deal with diabetes,\u201d he said, \u201cif I can beat melanoma.\u201d\n\nEvidence of these challenges is decades old.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Matthew Krummel, a young immunology graduate student known as Max, worked at a lab at the University of California, Berkeley, that would become one of the most influential in the development of immunotherapy. The lab was run by Dr. James Allison, who, along with Dr. Krummel, published a seminal paper in 1995 showing that they could eliminate tumors in mice by turning off a brake on the immune system.\n\nBut the lab got less attention for a related experiment: The skin of some mice treated this way turned from black to white. They had lost their pigmentation, a result of the immune system\u2019s attacking the cells that make melanin. The startling change was not life-threatening but indicated the power of tinkering with the immune system.\n\nThis discovery was novel but not particularly celebrated compared with the promise of curing cancer, Dr. Krummel recalled. The skin study \u201cwas kind of a footnote,\u201d he said.\n\nThen came the TeGenero tragedy in 2006.\n\nTeGenero Immuno Therapeutics designed a drug to stimulate the immune system to fight leukemia. At Northwick Park Hospital in London, a Phase 1 trial took place, with six healthy patients getting the drug. Within hours, all suffered multiorgan failure.\n\nThe devastating results tempered the enthusiasm and suggested that more work needed to be done in advance of human trials. But enthusiasm came roaring back. Part of the reason was that, ultimately, the autoimmune reactions were seen not only as an acceptable cost of these drugs but as evidence they were working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the beast,\u201d said Martin Bachmann, a professor and immunologist at the Jenner Institute, which is affiliated with Oxford University. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you can get rid of the side effects \u2014 it\u2019s really what you want.\u201d\n\nChemotherapy, too, has side effects, but Dr. Kluger prefers immunotherapy\u2019s trade-offs because the drugs may offer enduring control of cancer without the need for continued treatment. So she is joining others looking to address largely unanswered questions: Who is likely to be at risk, can the side effects be recognized before turning dangerous, and how should they be treated?\n\nIn June, Dr. Kluger and Dr. Herold submitted a grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health to study whether they could predict which patients would develop these symptoms. They based the proposal on a hypothesis that some patients have a biology or a genetic background that might make them more likely to have side effects. The proposal has not yet been funded.\n\nThus far, only a modicum of work has been done on these questions. Several studies found that older mice were more susceptible than younger mice to autoimmune reactions; another study, also in mice, found that obese subjects were more likely to have adverse effects.\n\n\u201cOld or fat mice were literally dead within hours,\u201d said Dr. Murphy, the professor at Davis who believes too little is being done. He is well positioned to see the trends: In the past year, he sat on eight government grant review committees focused on immunotherapy, and he said only three out of 500 research proposals he reviewed focused on the toxicity side of immunotherapy.\n\nPart of the problem, he said, is that the drug companies that are driving research prefer working with labs that support trials\u2019 moving quickly. As a result, Dr. Murphy said, human trials are advancing faster than the background research can be done.\n\nHoping to push access to lifesaving drugs, the Food and Drug Administration has a \u201cbreakthrough therapy designation\u201d that allows faster approval. Since 2012, the agency has granted breakthrough designation about 110 times, almost a quarter of them for immunotherapy.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk about moonshots, they\u2019re talking about curing cancer, but it has to look at the whole picture,\u201d Dr. Murphy said.\n\nWith so much momentum pushing for a cure, the emphasis from researchers and front-line oncologists is on more vigilance about the side effects. Dr. Timmerman, from U.C.L.A., said he wished he had seen the signs of trouble in his patient, who survived cancer only to die in the emergency room after exhibiting seemingly modest flulike symptoms.\n\n\u201cIf we had only known the power we had unleashed that was causing such a toll on her organ system, we might have saved her,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have to manage this hour by hour,\u201d he added. \u201cMinute by minute.\u201d\n", "adults people age older immunizing skipping arent vaccinations vigilant protecting careful children": "\nLouise Abate first noticed an itchy tingle near her hairline. The pain started a day or two later as a blistering rash swept down from her scalp onto her forehead. \u201cMy eye was so swollen I couldn\u2019t open it,\u201d she said.\n\nShingles. Ms. Abate, 76, a retired casino supervisor in Rio Rancho, N.M., had had the disease twice before, in her 60s, but the episode three years ago hit particularly hard.\n\nLong after the rash healed, which took about three weeks, she suffered the complication called postherpetic neuralgia \u2014 lingering nerve pain that can last for months or even, as in her case, years. \u201cI get up every day, and it\u2019s there,\u201d she said. \u201cI go to sleep, and it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nShe had heard something about a shingles vaccine, but \u201cI really didn\u2019t pay attention,\u201d Ms. Abate confessed. And she is hardly unusual.\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing and vexing public health problem: People once vigilant about vaccinating their children aren\u2019t nearly as careful about protecting themselves as they age, even though diseases like influenza, pneumonia and shingles (a.k.a. herpes zoster) are particularly dangerous for older people.\n\n\u201cTrying to prevent these common and often debilitating conditions is incredibly important for older adults,\u201d said Dr.Carolyn Bridges, associate director for adult immunization at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet in the C.D.C.\u2019s 2014 and 2015 reports on vaccination coverage, she said, \u201cwe really didn\u2019t see much change.\u201d\n\nMost Americans over 65 get an annual flu shot, but the proportion actually declined a few percentage points last season to about 63 percent. The C.D.C. estimates that of the 226,000 people hospitalized for flu in an average year, 50 percent to 70 percent are over 65; so are the great majority of those who die from it. \u201cOlder adults take the brunt,\u201d Dr. Bridges said.\n\nSimilarly, in 2014, about 61 percent of older adults had received one or both of the two pneumococcal vaccines, which protect against pneumococcal infections that can lead to pneumonia and meningitis. That represented no improvement, leaving millions of older people still vulnerable.\n\nAbout 58 percent of older people had been vaccinated against tetanus during the past 10 years, but only 14 percent had received the recommended dose of the Tdap vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough. It\u2019s especially important for grandparents and others who have contact with infants too young to be vaccinated.\n\nAnd elders have been particularly slow to take advantage of the shingles vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration approved it a decade ago, and the C.D.C. recommends it for those over 60, including those who\u2019ve already had shingles.\n\nCoverage has climbed steadily, but in 2014 had still reached only 31 percent of those over 65. As with nearly all of these vaccines, older whites were more likely to have been vaccinated than blacks, Hispanics or Asians.\n\nWhy these missed opportunities?\n\n\u201cVaccines are less likely to be routinely incorporated in adult medical practice,\u201d Dr. Bridges said. \u201cEvery time a child comes in, a pediatrician makes sure they\u2019re up-to-date.\u201d\n\nOlder adults often have medical issues that take precedence during brief office visits. They also see specialists who are more focused on cardiology or oncology than on flu and shingles.\n\nSeniors and their caregivers should request vaccinations; the C.D.C. publishes guidelines and a quiz that explain which ones are recommended. Zostavax, the current shingles vaccine, reduces the risk of the disease in adults over 60 by half, and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds.\n\n(Quick primer: Shingles results from the same virus that causes chickenpox, which nearly all older Americans have had. The virus typically remains dormant for decades, but the odds of its reactivation rise steeply after 50 as the immune system weakens. The lifetime risk of shingles is one in three, rising to one in two for those over 85.)\n\nThe vaccine\u2019s underuse can be blamed, in part, on supply shortages in its early years until about 2012. The manufacturer, Merck, and the C.D.C. didn\u2019t increase media campaigns until vaccine supplies were sufficient; such campaigns had just started when Ms. Abate became ill. It\u2019s not surprising that she was only vaguely aware of Zostavax.\n\n(She\u2019s starting to feel better, but still needs a sedative to sleep and Zoloft for the depression that chronic pain can produce. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long road,\u201d she said. Now vaccinated against a shingles recurrence, she\u2019s urging her children to get the shot.)\n\nCost remains a barrier to getting Zostavax and some other adult vaccines.\n\nIn a study published this past summer, researchers reported that nearly 40 percent of the time, patients over 50 who requested a prescription for Zostavax at a pharmacy chain chose not to receive the vaccine; out-of-pocket costs were most frequently the reason.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover Zostavax without co-pays for people older than 60, and many cover it for policyholders over 50. But Medicare beneficiaries find that, unlike the flu and pneumococcal vaccines, which are covered under Part B and often administered in physicians\u2019 offices, Zostavax and Tdap are covered under Part D.\n\nPhysicians can\u2019t easily bill for Part D reimbursement, so they often send patients to pharmacies, which can. But because Part D involves a welter of different plans and formularies, some requiring patients to pay for the vaccine and then seek reimbursement, the cost and co-pays can discourage use. Zostavax, at about $200 a dose, is the most expensive adult vaccine.\n\nThis landscape could change drastically in a year or so. In October, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline submitted a new shingles vaccine for F.D.A. approval.\n\nInternational studies indicate that the newcomer, Shingrix, is far more effective than the current vaccine, reducing the incidence of shingles by 90 percent. Moreover, the effectiveness doesn\u2019t appear to decrease among older age groups, as Zostavax\u2019s does.\n\nShingrix has its own drawbacks. For one, it requires a second injected dose several months after the first; some people won\u2019t follow up. The manufacturer has yet to set a price, and unless Congress changes the law, any new vaccine will face the same Part D billing complications.\n\nBut if the F.D.A. approves it, and the C.D.C. recommends its use (which triggers insurance coverage), Shingrix may also prevent a lot of shingles cases \u2014 but only if older adults are actually vaccinated.\n\nThey don\u2019t have a great track record.\n\nPublic health leaders don\u2019t want older adults waiting to see what the F.D.A. does. One million Americans will get shingles in the coming year; the C.D.C. wants seniors to get vaccinated now.\n\nDr. Bridges endorsed a unfestive but pragmatic holiday gift idea I suggested: a card with a promise to take an older family member to get vaccinated, and to pay any charge or co-pay.\n\nDr. Bridges suggested another gift: that younger family members get flu shots themselves. Since more than a third of older adults don\u2019t, families can at least avoid infecting their senior members at holiday gatherings.\n\n\u201cGive them the shingles vaccine as a gift,\u201d Dr. Bridges said. \u201cBut don\u2019t give them the flu.\u201d\n", "cargo flight space liftoff agency roscosmos astronauts disappeared spacecraft carrying russian supplies ship burns": "\nA Russian spacecraft carrying 2.6 tons of food, fuel and supplies \u2014 but no astronauts \u2014 to the International Space Station failed to reach orbit on Thursday and largely burned up in the atmosphere as it fell back down.\n\nRoscosmos, the Russian space agency, reported that a Soyuz rocket carrying the Progress 65 cargo ship successfully lifted off from Kazakhstan. The first six minutes and 22 seconds of the flight proceeded normally. But shortly after the upper stage separated from the core booster, flight telemetry stopped, leaving ground controllers confused about what had happened.\n\nRoscosmos later confirmed that the Progress 65 and its cargo had been destroyed, with the failure occurring about 120 miles over Tuva, a Russian republic in southern Siberia.\n\nThe six astronauts at the space station \u2014 three Russian, two American and one French \u2014 are safe and have adequate supplies, Roscosmos and NASA said.\n\nThe cargo included 1,400 pounds of propellant, 112 pounds of oxygen, 925 pounds of water, and 2,750 pounds of spare parts, supplies and scientific experiment hardware. NASA said the Progress was not carrying any supplies crucial for the United States side of the space station.\n\nA Japanese cargo ship is scheduled to launch and head to the space station on Dec. 9.\n\nSpace station managers will have to do some juggling of plans and adjust coming cargo flights.\n\nThis is the fourth loss of a spacecraft carrying cargo to the space station in the past 25 months. In October 2014, an Antares rocket built by Orbital ATK exploded six seconds after it lifted off in Virginia. Six months later, a Russian Progress cargo ship spun out of control. Then, a Falcon 9 rocket built by SpaceX disintegrated during flight.\n\nBefore that, the space station program had experienced the loss of only one cargo ship \u2014 another Progress, in August 2011 \u2014 in nearly 16 years. This fall, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called for accelerated construction at a new launch site to replace the current Cosmodrome, which Russia leases from Kazakhstan.\n\nThe financially ailing Russian space program will temporarily reduce the number of crew members to two from three at the space station next year.\n\nIn recent months, the flow of supplies to the space station appeared to be getting back on track.\n\nAn Antares rocket with different engines successfully reached the space station in October. Several Progress ships successfully ferried cargo to the space station before Thursday\u2019s failure. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 also resumed flights but then was grounded again after one of the Falcon 9 rockets exploded on the launchpad during fueling for an engine test.\n\nSpaceX is now aiming to resume the launching of commercial satellites this month, and its next cargo flight is planned for January 2017.\n\nNASA officials now seem prescient in asking Orbital ATK to launch its next cargo mission with an Atlas 5 rocket, built by United Launch Alliance, rather than an Antares rocket. Although the redesigned Antares worked well, the Atlas 5 has a long, successful track record and it can lift a heavier payload, allowing NASA to pack in more supplies. That mission is to take off in the spring.\n", "increased reduce schooling sunlight nearsightedness report researchers risk": "\nExposure to sunlight may reduce the risk for nearsightedness, a new study reports.\n\nResearchers recruited 371 men and women with nearsightedness, or myopia, and 2,797 without. Their average age was 72. They gave them eye examinations, took blood samples and interviewed them about their health and behavior over the years, estimating exposure to ultraviolet B rays.\n\nThe study, in JAMA Ophthalmology, found that those with the highest UVB exposure, especially in the teenage and young adult years, had about a 30 percent lower risk for myopia than those with the lowest exposure. Exposure to sunlight increases vitamin D levels, but vitamin D levels did not correlate with nearsightedness.\n\nThey also found that more schooling increased the risk of nearsightedness. Those in the highest one-third in years of education had more than double the risk of myopia compared to those in the lowest one-third. The reason for the effect, which was independent of UVB exposure, remains unknown.\n\nThe researchers were surprised to find that people with the highest blood levels of lutein, a nutrient found in leafy vegetables, had a 43 percent reduced risk of nearsightedness compared with those with the lowest levels.\n\n\u201cSpending time outdoors is good advice for trying to reduce the chance of getting myopia,\u201d said the senior author, Astrid E. Fletcher of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, though she advised against spending time outdoors in the middle of the day, when skin cancer risks increase.\n", "conference biased mr trump cnns heckled easy jeffrey maintained station candidates coverage aides fair president zucker news presidential": "\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Jeffrey A. Zucker, CNN\u2019s president, is accustomed to complaints about his network going easy on Donald J. Trump: providing extensive coverage of his rallies, letting him phone in for interviews and hiring his former campaign manager as an analyst.\n\nRarely, however, does Mr. Zucker \u2014 or any television news executive, for that matter \u2014 face the kind of A-list revolt that brewed here Wednesday evening.\n\nIn extraordinary exchanges, aides to Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush openly accused Mr. Zucker of enabling Mr. Trump and undermining their candidates in the Republican primary, heckling from their seats as Mr. Zucker spoke on a panel in a hotel ballroom.\n\n\u201cYou showed hours upon hours of unfiltered, unscrutinized coverage of Trump!\u201d shouted Todd Harris, a top adviser for Mr. Rubio. A Washington Post reporter, Karen Tumulty, prompted applause when she pressed Mr. Zucker on why he allowed Trump surrogates to spread falsehoods on his network.\n\nIt was a visceral airing of grievances before an audience of the country\u2019s leading political operatives and journalists, gathered for what is typically a staid postelection conference at Harvard. And it captured CNN\u2019s lightning-rod position in the debate over the role of the media in Mr. Trump\u2019s rise and, now, his looming presidency.\n\nSince Election Day, Mr. Trump has singled out CNN for criticism, posting on Twitter that the network had \u201ctotal (100%) support of Hillary Clinton\u201d and chastising Mr. Zucker during a private meeting with television executives at Trump Tower. Yet media commentators have accused CNN of giving preferential treatment to Mr. Trump to lift ratings. The network is on track this year to collect $1 billion in profit.\n\n\u201cCNN helped make him by carrying every speech he made in the primary season,\u201d Larry King, the former CNN anchor and a friend of Mr. Trump, said in an interview. \u201cIt was almost like the other guys didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nMr. Zucker, for his part, was steadfast on Wednesday that his network covered Mr. Trump and the election fairly, telling attendees that the Manhattan businessman routinely made news \u201cand we are in the business of covering news.\u201d He pointed to tough questioning of Mr. Trump by Anderson Cooper and Jake Tapper, and said that the bipartisan contentiousness over CNN\u2019s coverage gave him comfort, not anxiety.\n\n\u201cHalf the people want to blame us for Trump, and half the people want to say that we\u2019re terrible to Trump,\u201d Mr. Zucker said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I always think we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nFor all the complaints from vanquished rivals, Mr. Trump has been no fan of CNN in recent weeks, especially after the network \u2014 along with other news organizations \u2014 discredited the president-elect\u2019s false claim that millions of illegal ballots cost him the popular vote.\n\nMr. Trump thinks that CNN\u2019s coverage of him turned negative at the start of the general election, according to a person with direct knowledge of his thinking. He also thinks that he helped advance the career of Mr. Zucker, whom he has known for years since they worked together at NBC on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Trump recommended Mr. Zucker as the next president of CNN during a dinner at the Plaza Hotel with Phil Kent, then the chief executive of Turner, CNN\u2019s parent company, according to three people with knowledge of the hiring process, who were granted anonymity to share private conversations.\n\nMr. Trump believes he was instrumental in getting Mr. Zucker that job, the people said, although Mr. Kent had already been discussing the position with Mr. Zucker and his conversation with Mr. Trump lasted only a few minutes.\n\nClad on Wednesday in a silky pinstripe suit, Mr. Zucker seemed aware that he might be in for an onslaught. The first question \u2014 had Mr. Trump been good for CNN? \u2014 set off snickers in the audience, and Mr. Zucker\u2019s co-panelist, Kathleen Carroll of The Associated Press, smiled. \u201cBa dum bum,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Zucker conceded, as he has in the past, that he broadcast too many unedited Trump rallies in the early months of the campaign. But he rejected claims of bias, saying that rival candidates received ample invitations to appear and rarely accepted.\n\n\u201cPeople should think about the decisions they made not to come on the cable news networks,\u201d Mr. Zucker said, even as some campaign aides in the audience argued that Mr. Trump was featured as a ratings draw, and treated less aggressively. When Sasha Issenberg, the moderator, suggested that the panel move from CNN \u201cto a less contentious subject, fake news,\u201d Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, piped up.\n\n\u201cYou just covered that!\u201d he said.\n\nIn books, Mr. Trump has referred to Mr. Zucker as \u201ca total dynamo,\u201d \u201cthe best in the business\u201d and \u201cbrilliant.\u201d Those compliments have faded. In September, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that Mr. Zucker \u201cfailed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy relationship with him didn\u2019t seem to help that much,\u201d Mr. Zucker, who has spoken privately with Mr. Trump since the election, said on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhether Mr. Trump likes it or not, CNN, like other cable news networks, stands to gain financially from a Trump administration. John Martin, chief executive of CNN\u2019s parent company, Turner, said at a Code Media conference on Wednesday that CNN \u201cis completing its Hall of Fame year,\u201d and he expects the network\u2019s ratings to stay high.\n\n\u201cWith the Trump administration,\u201d Mr. Martin said, \u201cthere will be a general fascination that wouldn\u2019t be the same as under a Clinton administration.\u201d\n\nHow that plays out journalistically is another question. On Wednesday, Mr. Zucker defended his hiring of Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s ex-campaign manager, who was constrained as an analyst by a nondisclosure agreement with the Trump campaign. \u201cIt was important to have people who could give us a peek into what people supporting Trump were thinking,\u201d Mr. Zucker said.\n\nGiven that few predicted Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, Mr. Zucker said, \u201cthat insight turns out to have been exactly the right thing to have had, and I\u2019m proud that we did it.\u201d\n\nThat prompted Ms. Tumulty of The Post to ask Mr. Zucker why he allowed on so many \u201cnut job surrogates\u201d to appear, noting that some Trump supporters told lies, which CNN anchors had to correct. \u201cAt what point do you say you cannot come on our air anymore because you have told too many lies?\u201d Ms. Tumulty asked.\n\nMr. Zucker said it was up to viewers to decide whether a supporter offered a compelling case for their candidate. And he circled back to the notion that televising Mr. Trump\u2019s words was one thing; voters choosing to support him was another.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cit is up to the viewer to say whether that augurs well for their candidate or not.\u201d\n", "necessities basic wildlife responsible saving tents poachers personnel forgotten park boots rangers step health fending groups african protecting insurance change": "\nISIOLO, KENYA \u2014 Anna Phiri was 15 when her mother, a park ranger in Zambia, was murdered by poachers.\n\nOn Sept. 2, 2010, Esnart Paundi was standing guard with a colleague over two men they had caught with illegal bushmeat. What happened next is uncertain, but Ms. Phiri has heard that a third poacher, unknown to her mother, was hiding in the bush. He jumped out and slashed her colleague\u2019s head with a machete.\n\nMs. Paundi, who was unarmed, ran. But the poachers gave chase, and when they caught her, they killed her.\n\nMs. Paundi, 38, was the breadwinner for her five siblings, and she left behind five children, now orphans. Though she died serving her country and protecting its wildlife, she had no life insurance, and officials offered no assistance to her family. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even say anything to us,\u201d Ms. Phiri said.\n\nThe world depends on individuals like Ms. Paundi to protect increasingly imperiled wildlife. But many rangers do not receive the support they need. A recent World Wildlife Fund study of 570 rangers in 12 African countries found that 59 percent did not have basic supplies like boots, tents and GPS devices, and that 42 percent had not received adequate training.\n\nDespite the critical role rangers play in the poaching crisis, conservation organizations tend to overlook the need for everyday resources, said Peter Newland, the director of training at 51 Degrees, a private security company in Kenya.\n\n\u201cDonors outside of Africa want to see sexy, high-tech solutions like drones and ground sensors, not to hear about the need for warm clothing, boots and better food for rangers,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge nongovernmental groups spend huge amounts, yet there are rangers calling me for socks.\u201d\n\nThe wildlife fund study also found that 82 percent of rangers had faced life-threatening situations, including attacks by poachers and animals. Ms. Paundi was one of more than 1,000 rangers killed on the job over the past 10 years, according to the Thin Green Line Foundation, which supports park rangers and their families. Many receive little or nothing from the government.\n\nAnother World Wildlife Fund study, in 10 African countries, found that just 60 percent of rangers had health insurance, 50 percent had life insurance and 40 percent had long-term disability insurance.\n\n\u201cImagine how demotivating it would be to see a mate killed and then to witness his family removed from their house and his kids taken out of school because they receive no wage as a thank you for his sacrifice after he\u2019s gone,\u201d said Sean Willmore, who founded the Thin Green Line Foundation. \u201cMorale plays a massive role in reducing poaching.\u201d\n\nGovernmental corruption makes a ranger\u2019s job even more difficult in many parts of Africa. Poachers have been supported by officials in a number of countries. But rangers would be in trouble even if there were no corruption, Mr. Willmore said.\n\nIn the last two years, the foundation has spent $1.2 million on equipment and training for rangers and has supported more than 150 families of those killed in the line of duty, including Ms. Paundi\u2019s. The organization is putting her children through school.\n\nSimilarly, For Rangers, a charity co-founded by Mr. Newland that raises money through extreme racing events, has donated $200,000 worth of gear, vehicles, medical supplies and family aid to rangers at 10 parks throughout Africa since April 2014.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of recognition for the illegal wildlife trade crisis, but not a huge amount for the people really doing the day-to-day work to stop it,\u201d said Sam Taylor, a co-founder of For Rangers and the head of conservation projects at 51 Degrees.\n\nBut small nonprofit groups can support only a fraction of the estimated 20,000 to 25,000 rangers working in Africa.\n\n\u201cPerformance is definitely affected by the lack of insurance, combined with the high risk factor and the lack of training and equipment,\u201d said Rohit Singh, the lead author of the World Wildlife Fund studies. \u201cHow can we expect rangers to deliver if they do not have these basic things?\u201d\n\nWhen rangers are well taken care of and receive appropriate training, poaching rates tend to drop, Mr. Singh and Mr. Willmore said.\n\nLewa Wildlife Conservancy, a wildlife sanctuary in Kenya, for example, was losing unprecedented numbers of rhinoceroses when it overhauled its operations in 2014. To turn things around, the conservancy invested in specialized training, brought in a helicopter, installed a new communications system and strengthened relationships with local communities.\n\nSince then, Lewa has not lost a single rhino.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when rhinos were poached here so often that we were becoming scared, but we\u2019ve tried our best and we\u2019ve stopped it,\u201d said Francis Kobia Chokera, 44, a ranger at Lewa. \u201cWe had security before, but not like it is now. It\u2019s very, very tight.\u201d\n\nMr. Chokera\u2019s job is still demanding: He patrols on foot for 12 hours a day, and like 47 percent of the rangers interviewed by the wildlife fund, he sees his family fewer than five days per month. But he has insurance, earns around $3,600 a year \u2014 more than two times the average income in Kenya \u2014 and receives overtime, free housing and a pension.\n\n\u201cBy good luck, I was given the chance to work here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved animals.\u201d\n\nTimothy Tear, executive director for the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Africa program, said that success stories like Lewa\u2019s are \u201cwhere hope is found.\u201d He noted that the conservancy\u2019s considerable investment in security and ranger training \u2014 $1 million a year \u2014 has been integral to its success.\n\n\u201cIf you do the simple math of dollars spent to acres protected, you will find Lewa at the top of the investment-per-acre gradient,\u201d Dr. Tear said.\n\nOther protected areas that have received large investments in ranger training and support \u2014 like the Sabi Sand Game Reserve in South Africa \u2014 have seen similar gains against poachers. In 2013, the reserve lost 51 rhinos, but only two have been killed this year.\n\n\u201cOur rangers were herders, but now they\u2019re effectively soldiers,\u201d said David Powrie, Sabi Sand\u2019s warden. \u201cThey\u2019re at the center of all our operations.\u201d\n\nFor now, such cases are the exception, but Mr. Willmore said better and broader training could be a first step toward improving working conditions for rangers across Africa. The Thin Green Line Foundation plans to teach 30 to 50 exceptional rangers the skills needed to be trainers themselves, and then host six events a year at which they would instruct their colleagues.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, most training rangers get, if any, is expensive and done by expats, and there\u2019s no follow-up,\u201d Mr. Willmore said. \u201cBy training the trainers, we will potentially reach over 15,000 rangers in the next five years and help change the game on the ground.\u201d\n\nThough training would not solve problems like a lack of insurance and equipment, it could save the lives of both animals and rangers. Recently, a ranger who had been taught self-defense was attacked by a poacher with a machete and was able to use a stick to knock down the suspect and arrest him, said Craig Millar, the head of security for Kenya\u2019s Big Life Foundation, a community conservation group.\n\nMs. Paundi, the ranger in Zambia, had no such training. \u201cProtecting wildlife is good, but my mom didn\u2019t have enough protection herself,\u201d said Ms. Phiri, her daughter. \u201cI believe if my mother had the proper training, equipment and security, she would still be alive today.\u201d\n", "advice savage djs writer love complexities dan modern story adoptions dark reads columnist homeless weeks podcast open mommy": "\nIn this week\u2019s podcast, the author and advice columnist Dan Savage reads \u201cDJ\u2019s Homeless Mommy,\u201d his 2005 essay about the baggage that can come with an open adoption.\n\nYou can listen to his reading using the player above, or find the episode on iTunes and Google Play Music.\n\nMr. Savage is the creator of the syndicated advice column Savage Love, which focuses on sex and relationships.

The resulting crater then partially filled with denser nitrogen ice and possibly a bulge of liquid water from an underground ocean, and the additional mass caused Pluto to roll over, perhaps as much as 60 degrees, to its present configuration, the scientists conclude.\n\n\u201cThese are interesting and plausible papers,\u201d said David J. Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved with either paper.\n\nThe matter is simply gravity.\n\n\u201cIf you take Pluto and you put an extra weight on the surface of Pluto, then Pluto will roll over so that weight moves toward the equator and toward either the point directly underneath Charon or the point opposite that,\u201d said Francis Nimmo, a professor of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lead author of one of the Nature papers.\n\nDr. Nimmo argues that the rolling over of Pluto is additional evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath the icy crust.\n\nThe other researchers, led by James T. Keane, a graduate student at the University of Arizona, mapped networks of cracks on the surface that they say are the places where Pluto ruptured as a result of tectonic forces as it rolled over.\n\n\u201cImagine you have an egg, and you want to move that bulge to another part of the egg,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cYou have to squish it, and that\u2019s going to cause it to break.\u201d\n\nAs Pluto reoriented, its spin axis largely remained pointing in the same direction. From the perspective of someone on the surface, it would have seemed that the location of the north pole was changing, in what astronomers call \u201ctrue polar wander.\u201d\n\nThe starting point of the research for both teams was the revelation of a bright splotch on the surface of Pluto just north of the equator in the shape of a Valentine heart, in images captured during the flyby of NASA\u2019s New Horizons spacecraft last year. Mission scientists named the splotch Tombaugh Regio after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto. (\u201cRegio\u201d is the Latin word for \u201cregion.\u201d)\n\nPluto and Charon today are in what astronomers call a mutually tidally locked orbit of 6.4 days, the same side of Charon always facing Pluto, and the same side of Pluto facing Charon.\n\nAstronomers including Dr. Nimmo and Mr. Keane noticed that the left side of the bright heart, named Sputnik Planitia, is almost exactly on the side opposite from Charon, and it did not seem likely that it ended up there by chance.\n\n\u201cSputnik Planitia is located very close to that special point,\u201d Dr. Nimmo said, \u201cand so that makes you suspect Sputnik Planitia represents an extra weight.\u201d\n\nThe left lobe is elliptical, a 600-mile-wide depression that looks like a crater that was carved by an ancient impact. At first glance, that would seem to undercut the argument. \u201cSputnik Planitia is a hole in the ground,\u201d Dr. Nimmo said, \u201cso it shouldn\u2019t be excess mass. It should have less mass.\u201d\n\nFor this idea to work, the scientists had to explain how to make a hole in the ground be heavier, not lighter. If Sputnik Planitia had less mass, it should have rotated toward one of the poles instead.\n\nDr. Nimmo and his colleagues argue that water from an underground ocean welled upward, adding mass, because liquid water is denser than frozen water. (With Pluto\u2019s frigid temperatures, the water would have to be loaded with antifreeze \u2014 most likely ammonia \u2014 for it not to freeze.)\n\nNew Horizons detected a glacier of nitrogen ice, which is also denser than water ice, covering Sputnik Planitia.\n\nMr. Keane does not argue against an ocean, but he said a thick layer of nitrogen ice might be sufficient explanation.\n\nDouglas P. Hamilton, an astronomy professor at the University of Maryland, agrees that Sputnik Planitia is a heavy spot that caused Pluto to roll over, but he disagrees with the premise that it started as an impact crater.\n\nDr. Hamilton said he has a paper scheduled to run in the same print issue of Nature as the other two that explains how the basin could have formed simply from the weight of nitrogen ices pushing down on the crust. Because the paper has not yet been published online, he said he was prohibited by Nature\u2019s embargo policy from discussing details of his research.\n\nA spokeswoman for Nature said the journal\u2019s policy is to not talk about papers with anyone other than the authors until one week before publication.\n\nDr. Nimmo said Pluto\u2019s reorientation occurred quickly, within a few thousand years. Mr. Keane\u2019s model suggests that the change occurred more slowly, between one and 10 million years, to give the nitrogen ice enough time to accumulate in the basin.\n\nChecking the idea could prove impossible until planetary scientists are able to precisely measure Pluto\u2019s gravity. \u201cTo really test that, you need to put something in orbit around Pluto,\u201d Dr. Nimmo said, \u201cand that\u2019s not going to happen for a while.\u201d\n", "owning climate considered implications youre longterm idea damageprone buying home smart change areas": "\nSo you want to buy a home in a global warming zone.\n\nWait, you weren\u2019t thinking of it that way? You didn\u2019t even realize it or think to check? Well, it\u2019s time to adjust your outlook.\n\nThat was my conclusion, at least, after reading my colleague Ian Urbina\u2019s recent article about climate change and the residential real estate market. No one knows when (or if) a panic may set in among insurance companies, lenders or home buyers \u2014 one that causes prices to fall and never recover in vulnerable areas. But given that homes are the most expensive thing that many of us ever purchase, it\u2019s foolish not to consider the long-term implications of owning one in a growing number of increasingly damage-prone places.\n\nThis is also an area of financial life that is ripe for mistakes and delusional thinking. Buying a home involves an enormous amount of money, and few people do it often enough to be experts. Given the realities of climate change, the process is now set against a backdrop of radical uncertainty about the very ground you will live on and the air you will breathe. Throw political uncertainty into the mix and \u2014 well, good luck keeping your head on straight.\n\nGiven all that, you owe it to yourself to call on every dispassionate expert you can find and grab all available data on any risk you are taking on. Here is how to get started:\n\nTHE TEAM Yes, you will want a real estate professional working with you who has deep knowledge of the local market and has lived through a few floods, fires or hurricanes.\n\nBut that is just the start. Sasha Krigsvold moved to low-lying Norfolk, Va., in 2006, and nobody told her until she was at the closing table that her home would need a special flood insurance policy. A secretary went off into another room to start getting quotes. Ms. Krigsvold\u2019s advice? Establish a relationship with a local insurance agent before you start shopping for homes.\n\nNext up: A municipal flood expert, preferably someone from town or city government who can explain any and all regulations you might need to know about when or if you ever want or need to fix your place up.\n\nIt was only after a renovation, when inspectors were in her basement, that Ms. Krigsvold learned that everyone involved thus far had not realized that they had put a bunch of expensive mechanical equipment too far below where it needed to be to satisfy local flood-mitigation building codes. She would have to pull out everything and start over.\n\nOr would she? \u201cI cried,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMore men were called from downtown. I had 10 people walking around at one point as I stood bouncing my first baby on my hip, in tears. And they all decided to look the other way. But that would not happen today.\u201d\n\nTHE INSURANCE Homeowners insurance generally does not cover floods. Your lender may make you buy flood insurance, depending on where you live. The federal government runs the program, though for-profit insurance companies sell and administer the policies.\n\nEven if it is not a requirement, read every word of the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s website on the flood insurance program before you buy a home. After nearly every big water-related weather event, whether it\u2019s in Louisiana, South Carolina or Texas, there are countless stories of people who did not have to buy flood insurance but wish that they had. FEMA\u2019s flood maps, which lenders use to figure out who to force to buy the coverage, are a good place to start. But keep in mind that they are backward-looking and do not account for global warming and its potential future impact.\n\nThe world of flood insurance is complicated \u2014 it can be expensive, and rules and maps sometimes change. All the more reason to shop as carefully for a local insurance agent as you would for a real estate professional, someone to whom you can pose any and every question you can think of \u2014 about the elevation certificate that governs the policy, grandfathering of old rates from previous owners, coverage limits and special policies that go beyond the standard amounts.\n\n\u201cYou should purchase the policy assuming that the loss will occur,\u201d said Christopher W. Heidrick, who runs an insurance agency in Sanibel, Fla. But you should also hope that it doesn\u2019t, given how much trouble some people have getting insurance companies to pay their claims in full after big storms.\n\nTHE DATA Want to know what sort of insurance claims the home has generated in the recent past? The information is available, but many home buyers don\u2019t know to ask for it.\n\nAt least two companies track this information, though you will generally need to either get the current homeowner to order a report or an insurance agent to do it for you. One report is called CLUE, for Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange, and the other is called A-PLUS.\n\nAs with any such report, these may be wrong or inconclusive. Get both, follow up with the homeowner and ask about any flood insurance claims or FEMA grants that may not show up on the reports. Real estate disclosure rules in general range wildly from state to state, so just assume that you will have to ask for this or any other pertinent information about past damage. If a seller balks at any of it, that is a really bad sign.\n\nOne other site worth checking is homedisclosure.com, which offers a free report on weather and environmental risks as well as local demographic information and all sorts of scary stuff about the local sex offender population and any former meth labs.\n\nAlso on the home-buying checklist that Robert W. Tull Jr., a financial planner in Chesapeake, Va., gives to clients is an exhortation to make like a reporter and talk to any potential neighbors. There may be flooding events that have caused problems that other research won\u2019t turn up.\n\nTHE HOUSE TOUR Have a house in mind? First, check the features. Spencer M. Houldin, president of Ericson Insurance Advisors in Washington Depot, Conn., suggests looking out for special impact-resistant glass in the windows or hurricane shutters. \u201cSometimes, the solution may be as simple as precut plywood to screw on,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Heidrick in Florida suggests a wind mitigation inspection, something that is standard in Florida but may not be elsewhere. Try to find a home inspector who can check how well the roof might hold up, in particular. He also recommends using the specs on the smarthomeamerica.org website as a guide.\n\nEllen Chamberlain, a Norfolk-based real-estate professional with Nancy Chandler Associates, looks for clues on her first pass through a basement, if a home has one. She can usually tell how much water has ever come in by how many cinder blocks high people have stored their belongings.\n\nOnce upstairs, a wholesale renovation, including new heating and cooling systems, is not always a good sign. \u201cBuyers from out of town get so excited about all that or the new hardwood floors,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I say \u2018Oh, wait a sec, it may be that the insurance company paid for all of that.\u2019\u201d And then she asks for a CLUE report to see about recent flooding.\n\nOutside, nearby trees can cause tens of thousands of dollars in damage if they fall. And in fire zones, you will need to learn about brush and all of the rules that come with it. Derek Ross, president of an insurance agency in Tarzana, Calif., said that people often forgot that much of his state was technically desert. And different insurance companies will make different demands about how much clearance a home needs from any brush that could catch fire.\n\nTHE MARKET All of the information you will gather from the tips so far is not predictive. Nothing is, especially with a president-elect who has said both that the Chinese invented global warming and also requested a sea wall to protect his Scottish golf course from it.\n\nBut fear in the mortgage industry is real. TD Bank was out pitching stories this week to random journalists with voluminous tips about buying a home, including an offer to speak to an expert. When I asked to speak to him about how or whether to buy in a global warming zone, however, the company went radio silent.\n\nIn those areas of the country, large numbers of people are staying away from any place where they might have to, say, pay for flood insurance. Maureen Green, a real estate professional in Harwich, Mass., on Cape Cod, with the firm Kinlin Grover, hears it from more than half of her buyers, given that even inland properties often have high premiums that will only grow, plus significant flooding risk. \u201cThey don\u2019t want something that they can\u2019t budget for,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to be in a flood zone to enjoy Cape Cod. There are so many beaches around.\u201d\n\nThere is a case for optimism here, where the world comes together and manages to turn the (rising) tides. So if you are a positive thinker or can afford a big loss, by all means bet one of your biggest assets on that possibility.\n\nOtherwise, ask yourself this: Just how much more science and weather will it take before ever larger numbers of people decide to settle in or retire to places that pose less risk? And once they do, do you want to be trying to unload your property in a danger zone so you can afford to join them?\n", "antacid milt ate ad classic appeared nightclubs commercial alkaseltzer actor tv dead moss mr thing": "\nMilt Moss, a comic actor who delivered the rueful catchphrase \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ate that whole thing\u201d in a memorable commercial for Alka-Seltzer in 1972, died on Sept. 26 in Manhattan. He was 93.\n\nHis nephew Roger Fox announced the death last Wednesday.\n\nMr. Moss was a nightclub comedian and master of ceremonies in the tradition of Henny Youngman. His comedy was based around well-trodden one-liners, bits and impersonations.\n\nHe opened for performers like the singer Robert Goulet and appeared on television with Milton Berle, Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson. He was also known as a master of the put-on, convincing unwitting audiences at official events that he was a legitimate speaker, like a chief executive or an ambassador, and then slowly veering from the reasonable into the absurd before revealing that he was a comedian.\n\nAnd he appeared in commercials, of which the most famous was the Alka-Seltzer spot. Written by Howie Cohen and directed by Bob Pasqualina, it featured Mr. Moss sitting on the side of his bed with a hangdog expression. He slowly shakes his head while repeating the line \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ate that whole thing.\u201d (The line is often remembered as \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ate the whole thing.\u201d)\n\nThe commercial struck a chord with dyspeptic viewers around the country, and in 1977 it was admitted to the advertising industry\u2019s Clio Awards Hall of Fame. The advertisement made Mr. Moss recognizable to a national audience, helping him book more conventions, club dates and TV appearances.\n\n\u201cThat commercial changed my whole life,\u201d Mr. Moss told the television historian Kliph Nesteroff in an interview in 2011.\n\nMr. Moss\u2019s most famous line has resurfaced in popular culture several times. For example, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ate the whole thing\u201d was the quotation accompanying Homer Simpson\u2019s unkempt high school yearbook photo on an episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d\n\nMilton Moss was born in the Bronx on Oct. 25, 1922, to Anton Moss and the former Eva Goldstein. His father was a comedian who performed as Eddie Clarke.\n\nMr. Moss attended N.Y.U. after graduating from high school. He then served in the Army from 1942 until 1945, entertaining troops at a facility in Belgium during World War II, and after his discharge turned to comedy and acting full time.\n\nIn the 1950s, he performed as a comedian and puppeteer on the Ray Heatherton children\u2019s show \u201cThe Merry Mailman.\u201d In 1965 he appeared on an episode of \u201cThe Patty Duke Show.\u201d\n\nHe married Dorothy Gorman in 1956. She died in 2000.

A new study suggests it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nResearchers at Cambridge University provided written information about the risk factors, prevention, treatment and consequences of Type 2 diabetes to 569 healthy middle-aged men and women.

The edition is a response to significant German interest in Charlie Hebdo after the attack, editors said this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment,\u201d G\u00e9rard Biard, Charlie Hebdo\u2019s editor in chief, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s an answer to this particular interest, which is not only about what happened and freedom of expression but also about ideas.\u201d\n\nMr. Biard said the paper had been the subject of numerous exhibitions, awards and news coverage in Germany since the attack on Jan. 7, 2015, in which two brothers, Sa\u00efd and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, stormed the offices in the 11th Arrondissement of Paris with assault rifles, leaving 12 dead.\n\nWith an initial print run of 200,000, the new edition will be available across Germany every Thursday. It will consist mostly of translated material from the French version, but with some original content for its German readers.\n\nThe first cover depicts a worn-out-looking Chancellor Angela Merkel lying on a hydraulic lift, with a caption saying that the embattled German carmaker Volkswagen \u201cstands behind Merkel\u201d and that \u201cwith a new exhaust pipe, she\u2019ll be good to go for another four years.\u201d\n\nCharlie Hebdo has been a lightning rod in the debate over balancing free speech and religious and cultural sensibilities. The newspaper was targeted by jihadists after it published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, but it also regularly takes aim at the Vatican and the European political establishment.\n\nDetractors have accused Charlie Hebdo of heedlessly printing incendiary and racist imagery, while supporters see it as a symbol of free expression and Western liberal values.\n\nThe newspaper\u2019s \u201cSurvivors\u201d edition, published a week after the attack on its offices and once again depicting Muhammad, sold 70,000 copies in Germany, editors said.\n\nThe editor of the German edition, who uses the pseudonym Minka Schneider, said, \u201cGermans feel particularly close to France and to Charlie Hebdo, and the debate about freedom of expression is very passionate here compared to other countries.\u201d\n\nMs. Schneider, 33, who supervises a staff of 12, mostly translators in the Paris office, said that security was not the primary reason for concealing her real name. \u201cIt\u2019s really because I just want to focus on the journal, rather than fielding emails,\u201d she said.\n\nThe first German issue, with 16 pages, features a four-page travel feature by the cartoonist Laurent Sourisseau, who uses the pen name Riss, depicting people he met across Germany and their thoughts on cultural heritage, national identity and the influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them Muslims, in the last several years.\n\nThe reaction in the German news media has largely been positive, with a few exceptions. Martin Sonneborn, a prominent satirist, said in an interview with Deutsche Welle that Charlie Hebdo was \u201cliving off the attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that magazine will go over well in Germany,\u201d added Mr. Sonneborn, a former editor of Titanic, a satirical magazine, \u201cbecause it has such a specifically French aspect and represents a very unique type of humor.\u201d\n\nCharlie Hebdo\u2019s brand of satire tends to be harsher and darker than German counterparts like Titanic and Eulenspiegel. The editors acknowledge the challenge of appealing to a German audience but said the timing of the new edition was opportune.\n\n\u201cGermany is facing problems today that France already faced a few decades ago, like immigration and the banlieues,\u201d Ms. Schneider said, referring to the heavily immigrant neighborhoods that ring many French cities. \u201cSo maybe learning something about French society can help the Germans, and humor is a good way to do this.\u201d\n\nIf Charlie Hebdo is less concerned about causing offense than are most German publications, that may be a good thing, Mr. Biard suggested.\n\n\u201cIn Germany, you hear about the L\u00fcgenpresse a lot,\u201d he said, referring to a Nazi-era word meaning \u201clying press\u201d that has been taken up in recent years by far-right protesters accusing the mainstream German news media of dishonesty. \u201cI think no one can say to Charlie Hebdo that we\u2019re all politically correct. We don\u2019t think, \u2018Oh you cannot say this in Germany, you cannot do this.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody can be a subject in Charlie Hebdo,\u201d Mr. Biard continued. \u201cSo we feel pretty free to have a look at German society.\u201d\n", "hhs domestic signature weaken protections health tom care affordable drafted price act prices president law achievement remake empowering bill patients mr obamas consumer": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In choosing Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be his health secretary, President-elect Donald J. Trump has signaled an undiminished determination to repeal President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act, and replace it with a health law that would be far less comprehensive.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump is handing Republicans and their base voters what they have clamored for since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010 \u2014 a powerful force to reverse course.\n\nRepublicans were pleased.\n\n\u201cI can tell you where we\u2019re going to start: with a process to repeal and replace Obamacare,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Tuesday.\n\nMr. Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Atlanta\u2019s affluent northern suburbs, was one of the first lawmakers to draft a full replacement for the Affordable Care Act. His proposal would take health care in a fundamentally different direction, away from mandated coverage and care and toward a free-market approach, with fewer consumer protections and more freedoms for doctors.\n\n\u201cThe president-elect has made it very clear: He wants the Congress, when they convene in early January, to take up the task of repealing and replacing Obamacare first,\u201d Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Tuesday on Fox News. He described Mr. Price as \u201csomeone who literally, for the last half a dozen years, has been in the forefront of efforts, not only to repeal Obamacare, but put forward common sense, free-market solutions that will lower the cost of health insurance, without growing the size of government.\u201d\n\nSome 20 million uninsured people have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, reducing the nation\u2019s uninsured rate to 8.6 percent, the lowest on record, the Obama administration says. The Congressional Budget Office has not estimated the cost of Mr. Price\u2019s legislation or its effects on coverage, but opponents say the human cost would be steep.\n\nThe Price bill, the Empowering Patients First Act, would weaken many protections for consumers in the Affordable Care Act. The law, for example, prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher rates because of a person\u2019s pre-existing medical conditions. Under the bill, this type of protection would be available to people who have maintained coverage in the past \u2014 for example, people moving to the individual market from an employer\u2019s health plan.\n\nThe federal requirement for most Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty would be eliminated, as would the requirement for larger employers to offer coverage. Billions of dollars that 31 states expect to receive for expanding Medicaid eligibility would also disappear.\n\nInstead, Mr. Price would offer tax credits for the purchase of individual and family health insurance policies. The credits would increase as people grow older and are likely to need more medical care. He would use other tax breaks to coax more people into contributing to health savings accounts that could be used to help pay medical expenses. Such accounts are championed by conservatives as a way to slow the growth of health costs.\n\nThe bill would make it easier for doctors to defend themselves against medical malpractice lawsuits. Patients would have a heavier burden of proof if doctors could show that they followed \u201cclinical guidelines\u201d for the treatment of medical conditions.\n\nAnd under the legislation, it would be easier for doctors to enter into private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries. Such contracts allow physicians to opt out of Medicare\u2019s strictures and charge more than the amounts normally allowed.\n\nThe bill would eliminate the federal health insurance exchange, through which millions of people have obtained subsidies for the purchase of insurance coverage. States could contract with private entities to set up websites that resemble HealthCare.gov, but only to provide information on insurance plans\u2019 prices and benefits and their networks of doctors and hospitals. The new websites could not directly enroll people in private plans or in Medicaid.\n\nFrom his days as a Georgia state senator, Mr. Price, now 62, has been a voice for doctors, and if confirmed by the Senate, he could use his post as health secretary to protect fellow physicians in myriad ways. As health secretary, he would have real power, not only through his influence with Congress but also through the regulatory levers of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHis bill says that doctors would generally be \u201cexempt from the federal antitrust laws\u201d when they engage in contract negotiations with health insurance plans over the terms of their service. In many cases over the years, the federal government has accused doctors of violating antitrust laws in their dealings with insurers.\n\nThe legislation would also offer federal grants to states for \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d to subsidize insurance for people who might otherwise have difficulty finding coverage in the open market because of \u201cthe existence or history of a medical condition.\u201d\n\nSuch pools have not worked so well in the past, and Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, expressed doubts about their effectiveness.\n\n\u201cHigh-risk pools sound clever,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf said Tuesday, \u201cbut why would isolating the sickest people be expected to reduce the cost of insuring them?\u201d\n\nMr. Price\u2019s bill would also allow insurers licensed in one state to sell policies to residents of other states, a change that Mr. Trump often advocated in the campaign.\n\nBeyond the possible loss of coverage gains, Mr. Price\u2019s bill would be controversial for other reasons. One particularly contentious provision would limit the amount of tax-free coverage that workers could receive from their employers. The limits would be set at $8,000 for coverage of an individual employee and $20,000 for family coverage, with adjustments for inflation in later years.\n\nDemocrats are preparing for a fight. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next minority leader, called Mr. Price \u201cfar out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act and Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Tuesday that he had chosen Seema Verma, a health policy expert in Indiana, to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Working in state government and then as president of a consulting company, she helped Indiana expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, with conservative policies that emphasized \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d\n\nMs. Verma worked closely with Mr. Pence, the Indiana governor, who honored her this year with a Sagamore of the Wabash award, for Hoosiers who have made outstanding contributions to the state. She has won praise from health care providers and state legislators of both parties in Indiana, and has provided technical assistance to Medicaid officials in other states.\n\nMr. Price, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, has received generous campaign contributions from health care and related industries. In the latest cycle, he received $396,000 from health professionals, $181,900 from people who work for drug and other health-product companies, and more than $157,000 from people in the insurance business, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks money in politics.\n\nIn his campaign manifesto, Mr. Trump said Congress should give each state a lump sum of federal money \u2014 a block grant \u2014 for Medicaid, the program for lower-income people. Regardless of whether they can achieve that goal, Mr. Price and Ms. Verma would almost surely make it easier for states to obtain Medicaid waivers, the vehicle for a wide range of state innovations and experiments, which could include new eligibility rules and cost-sharing requirements.\n", "site olympic cheating skeleton world skipping support sochi boycott racers bobsled championships committee doping russian weigh athletes russia": "\nAmerican Olympians are considering boycotting a world championship event scheduled to be held in Sochi, Russia, in February, a move that would represent the most provocative gesture yet by athletes dissatisfied with how sports officials have responded to the continuing Russian doping scandal.\n\nAmerican athletes who compete in bobsled and skeleton have circulated memos laying out reasons to avoid participating in the world championships in Sochi, the site of the last Winter Olympics and of elaborate, state-sponsored cheating. The athletes have cited concerns about doping control, personal safety and information security.\n\nThe correspondence, some of which was obtained by The New York Times, indicates that the athletes have the support of the United States Olympic Committee. That organization has not taken a strong public stand on Russia\u2019s systemic doping as it seeks to curry favor with global sports leaders in a bid to hold the 2024 Summer Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThis has been passed down the line from the very highest level of sport, and now it\u2019s fallen into the lap of athletes,\u201d said Kyle Tress, an American skeleton racer. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous support to skip this event, and I think it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d\n\nThe United States Olympic Committee initially declined to comment. On Sunday, after this article was published online, a spokesman wrote that the organization supported athletes\u2019 rights to choose when and where to compete. \u201cThe U.S.O.C. does not, and will not, support blanket boycotts of any events,\u201d the spokesman added. \u201cAny decisions our athletes make will be supported independently from our bid for the 2024 Summer Games, which is independent and unrelated to these events.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Tress and other members of his sport\u2019s athlete advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend that if the competition was not relocated, American athletes should boycott the 2017 world championships. That event is key in determining rankings ahead of the following year\u2019s Winter Olympics, to be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nIn May, a longtime chief of Russia\u2019s antidoping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, told The New York Times of a cheating operation coordinated by the Russian government at the Sochi Olympics in 2014. Top Russian athletes doped during the competition, he said, and had their steroid-tainted urine replaced with clean urine for drug testing.\n\nAn investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency verified the account, with its report released in July, and results of another investigation due this week are expected to address which athletes benefited from the cheating.\n\n\u201cThe fact that nothing has been done about the Sochi scandal and the fact that we\u2019re still going to race there \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make us feel secure, or that they\u2019re taking the situation seriously,\u201d said Katie Uhlaender, an American skeleton racer.\n\nAt the Sochi Games, Ms. Uhlaender placed fourth, finishing 0.04 of a second behind the bronze medal winner, Elena Nikitina of Russia. Ms. Nikitina\u2019s urine sample was among those with which Dr. Rodchenkov said he had tampered, leaving Ms. Uhlaender wondering if she deserved a medal.\n\nThis year, numerous Olympic medals have been stripped from Russian athletes for doping offenses at the Games in London in 2012 and in Beijing in 2008 \u2014 but not at Sochi.\n\nAthletes who are advocating a Sochi boycott hope that the World Anti-Doping Agency\u2019s publication of a final investigative report on Friday will prompt a stronger response from the International Olympic Committee and the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, the sport\u2019s international governing body.\n\nAthletes are lobbying for the championships to be moved to a site outside Russia and for officials to revisit the standings of the 2014 Games as warranted. (The I.O.C. has appointed a disciplinary commission focused on Sochi, but it has not taken action ahead of the inquiry report expected this week.)\n\n\u201cPerhaps after the report comes out, they\u2019ll listen,\u201d Mr. Tress said. \u201cThere\u2019s politics and money and sponsors involved, but this is an opportunity to come out in favor of clean sport. And they\u2019ve missed that opportunity.\u201d\n\nIn July, after WADA published an initial report detailing state-sponsored cheating in Sochi, the I.O.C. provided guidance to sports organizations planning to host events in Russia.\n\n\u201cBecause of the detailed references to the manipulation of samples during the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014,\u201d the committee wrote in a news release, \u201cthe I.O.C. asks all International Olympic Winter Sports Federations to freeze their preparations for major events in Russia, such as world championships, World Cups or other major international competitions under their responsibility, and to actively look for alternative organizers.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, plans for February\u2019s championships have moved forward. The I.O.C. has not publicly clarified its guidelines, and the matter is expected to be discussed at the Olympic committee\u2019s executive board meetings in Switzerland this week.\n\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation did not respond to emails requesting comment.\n\n\u201cSochi is in Russia, and it\u2019s the place where the cheating happened,\u201d Ms. Uhlaender said. \u201cI\u2019m confused at how the I.O.C. said what it said, and we\u2019re still holding our world championships there.\u201d\n\nSuch confusion has transcended nationalities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the U.S. athletes,\u201d said Travis T. Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency. \u201cAthletes around the world are concerned about this, and it\u2019s a last resort,\u201d he added, referring to the consideration of boycotting competitions.\n\nLizzy Yarnold of Britain, who won a gold medal in skeleton at the Sochi Games, said in October that she was considering skipping the event in Sochi in February.\n\nThose traveling to Russia have concerns extending beyond drug testing, too, after recent Russian cyberattacks on WADA and Usada, and the theft of athletes\u2019 private medical information, raised information-security issues.\n\nAs groups of athletes organize, they are increasingly forcing national governing bodies to support their cause \u2014 an uncomfortable position for United States sports officials, who need the votes of global Olympic officials to win the right to host the 2024 Games. The race to hold that competition has narrowed to three bidders, with Los Angeles and Paris considered front-runners ahead of Budapest.\n\nIt was unclear how drug testing at the Sochi competition would be handled. WADA has decertified Russia\u2019s national antidoping agency, making the country ineligible to hold an Olympic competition. That ineligibility, some antidoping officials said, should carry over to other international sporting events.\n\n\u201cSo long as Russia is noncompliant, they should not have events there,\u201d said Thorhild Widvey, a politician from Norway who sits on WADA\u2019s executive committee.\n\nCraig Reedie, WADA\u2019s president, who is also a longtime I.O.C. member and has been criticized for seeming to run the regulatory agency more as politician than policeman, expressed eagerness last month for Russia to return to good standing. He invoked the country\u2019s willingness to host major international competitions \u2014 something fewer and fewer countries are vying for.\n\nMr. Tress said, \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a sufficient response from people in leadership positions, and there\u2019s a lot of frustration.\u201d\n", "bamboozled jason bishops century feel straight offer air turn chance audiences bewitched magic bothered illusionists": "\nDoes anyone actually believe in magic these days? Blame the Enlightenment. Blame Reddit. Whatever did it, nearly all of us now recognize magic as the work of expensive gadgetry, ordinary fraud and thousands of hours of solitary practice \u2014 time a magician might instead have spent bettering the world. Or at least meeting women.\n\nBesides, in this political moment, who wants to feel bewitched, bothered and bamboozled?\n\nA lot of us.\n\nLast week I saw two magic shows: Jason Bishop\u2019s \u201cStraight Up Magic\u201d at the New Victory Theater and \u201cThe Illusionists: Turn of the Century\u201d at the Palace Theater. The first was an introduction to conjuring for the elementary-school set and their credulous parents, the second a tribute to the legerdemain of times past. At each it was pleasant to murmur \u201cHow did he do that?\u201d about something as anodyne as a spectacular levitation.\n\nMr. Bishop is a New Jersey native who taught himself magic from books while he shuffled from one foster home to the next. With his motorcycle jacket and frayed jeans, he cultivates a tough-guy persona. But he\u2019s a nice kid trying to look like a mean one, his rebel-without-a-cape pose undercut by a goofy smile and some cheerful self-deprecation: \u201cI can melt right through jail bars, but I can\u2019t get my hands on \u2018Hamilton\u2019 tickets.\u201d It\u2019s also a relief to see a beautiful assistant (Kim Hess) favoring comfortable athleisure in place of spangled lingerie.\n\nIn a brief close-up routine, shared with the audience via live video, there\u2019s real elegance and even wit in the precision of his gestures, the agility of each finger. But Mr. Bishop\u2019s enthusiasm is for larger illusions, which he performs with only moderate bombast (though it wouldn\u2019t kill him to mellow out his music cues). He can teleport his assistant, he can vaporize a dog, he can walk through a wall, he can escape a locked box, he can tell some pretty funny jokes about Chris Christie and Halloween candy. He can astound, especially if you\u2019re one of the more junior audience members: \u201cThat\u2019s not real!\u201d gasped the 6-year-old pal I\u2019d brought with me.\n\nMore gasping could be heard at \u201cThe Illusionists,\u201d altogether a bigger, blingier and kitschier enterprise, but still a less grandiose occasion than the first two seasons of this ensemble evening. This time the enchanters favored the kinds of acts, and kinds of personal grooming, that were popular a century ago. This did not translate into scrupulous attention to historical accuracy \u2014 the evening begins with a videotaped sequence. It did, however, make for some nifty facial hair.\n\nAs music played, some live and some recorded, a few lavish set pieces unfurled, like a woman sawed in half (a fine trick accessorized with some graceless sex jokes) and an escape act featuring handcuffs, a burning rope and some very pointy spikes. This was performed by Jonathan Goodwin, the Daredevil, who later returned for a swell and far simpler bit with a bullwhip and a flower that apparently had it coming.\n\nMost of the evening\u2019s bright spots were quieter, less bedazzled affairs, like a marionette act from Justo Thaus, the Grand Carlini, or a merry linked rings routine from Charlie Frye, the Eccentric, or some dumb jokes from Dana Daniels, the Charlatan. \u201cYou\u2019re a magician\u2019s dream, kid,\u201d he said, when a youthful volunteer replaced his chosen card right on top of the deck. (The tot had identified his card as a \u201cthree of clovers,\u201d which was cute.)\n\nWhile the illusions were uniformly expert, several of the performers had a stilted, somewhat formal stage presence, like Rick Thomas, the Immortal, though his mustache was easily the evening\u2019s winner, and Thommy Ten and Am\u00e9lie van Tass, the Clairvoyants, who had a way of making even ordinary phrases sound odd and unidiomatic. \u201cI can tell you have a sweet tooth,\u201d Ms. van Tass said to an audience member faced with a dish of jelly beans. Then she had to repeat it. Their mind-reading act was top-notch, their patter a notch lower.\n\nBut the patter doesn\u2019t really matter. That\u2019s the thing about magic. Even when it\u2019s performed with something less than perfect flair or fluency, even when we know it to be entirely fake, it accesses fantasies we all have \u2014 to flee, to fly, to see, to survive what seems impossible. You can dematerialize a beautiful assistant, sure, but try making those desires disappear. \u201cWas that amazing?\u201d Mr. Bishop asked at the close of a routine. \u201cSort of,\u201d he answered himself. It was amazing enough.\n", "matt designated hitter deal serve louis reach month oneyear turn holliday production st expected years injuries declined yankees": "\nThe Yankees, having cleared more than $90 million from their payroll in the past six months, made their first foray into free agency in nearly two years on Sunday.\n\nBut a headfirst dive, with an accompanying big splash, this was not.\n\nThe Yankees instead waded into the free agent waters gingerly, filling their designated-hitter role by agreeing to a one-year, $13 million contract with the veteran outfielder Matt Holliday, according to a baseball official familiar with the terms who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was pending a physical.\n\nHolliday, a seven-time All-Star who will turn 37 next month, is coming off consecutive injury-plagued seasons in St. Louis, where he helped the Cardinals reach two World Series in seven and a half seasons. They won in 2011 and lost in 2013. Holliday also helped the Colorado Rockies to the World Series in 2007, when the Boston Red Sox won in a sweep.\n\nThe agreement with Holliday came just as baseball\u2019s winter meetings were about to kick off on Monday outside Washington, and it allowed the Yankees to shift their focus toward pitching. They are expected to pay special attention to the bullpen; three closers with strong track records are on the free-agent market: Aroldis Chapman, Kenley Jansen and Mark Melancon.\n\nLast winter, the Yankees were conspicuously the only team in baseball not to sign a free agent, though they did add Chapman and Starlin Castro through trades.\n\nYankees General Manager Brian Cashman said last month at the general managers\u2019 meetings that he expected to make few additions to the lineup, even though the Yankees\u2019 offense went through a severe decline last season. Cashman said he preferred to give young players such as outfielders Aaron Judge and Aaron Hicks, first baseman Greg Bird, catcher Gary Sanchez and perhaps others the opportunity to establish themselves as productive major leaguers.\n\nAfter the trade of catcher Brian McCann, who might have slid into the designated hitter\u2019s role with Sanchez\u2019s ascension, the addition of Holliday assures the presence of a player who has long been used to hitting in the middle of the lineup \u2014 something the Yankees lacked at the end of last season.\n\nIt also continues their recent tilt toward a more balanced lineup.\n\nThe Yankees in the past several seasons have had an almost exclusively left-handed-hitting lineup, trying to take advantage of the short right-field wall at Yankee Stadium. But they have found themselves susceptible to left-handed pitching. Now, with Holliday and Sanchez, they have two more right-handed power hitters alongside Castro, who hit 21 home runs last season.\n\nThe signing came one day after the Houston Astros signed Carlos Beltran to a one-year, $16 million contract to be their designated hitter. Beltran will turn 40 in April and was an All-Star with the Yankees last season before they traded him to Texas on Aug. 1. He was not pursued heartily by the Yankees, in large part, because Holliday, who has been a left fielder for most of his career, could still be used in the outfield on occasion and started nine games at first base last season. The Yankees were hamstrung at times in 2016 because Alex Rodriguez could not play in the field and Beltran had become increasingly less mobile.\n\nThe deal with Holliday also gives the Yankees some financial flexibility. Richer, long-term deals \u2014 with free agents like Mark Trumbo or Edwin Encarnacion, who were both coming off strong seasons \u2014 would have constricted their remaining spending options. Signing Trumbo or Encarnacion would have also cost the Yankees a first-round draft pick.\n\nIn taking a conservative route, the Yankees are hoping that Holliday can reverse his flagging production in recent seasons. His on-base-plus-slugging percentage declined each of the past three seasons, from .879 in 2013 to .811 in 2014, then to .804 in 2015, and finally to .782 last season, when he missed most of the final two months because of a fractured left thumb that he sustained when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Chicago Cubs reliever Mike Montgomery.\n\nHolliday returned on Sept. 30 with a pinch-hit home run, then played the final three games of the season as a farewell to Cardinals fans. He finished 2016 with 20 home runs, 20 doubles and 62 R.B.I. in 110 games last season.\n", "giants loss work beckham criticizes defeat crew blame officials games thought receiver worked officiating wide": "\nPITTSBURGH \u2014 Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. complained about the officiating after his team\u2019s 24-14 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday and said that the crew of officials that worked the game should not be allowed to work future Giants games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think we should have this crew anymore with the past history and everything that\u2019s gone on,\u201d Beckham said.\n\nBeckham said he \u201cwas pretty sure\u201d the same crew had worked in the Giants\u2019 controversial, penalty-filled game with the Carolina Panthers last season and this September\u2019s game with the Washington Redskins, which also included a number of penalties and after-the-whistle tussles between the teams.\n\nBeckham, known as one of the more emotional players in the N.F.L., also said Sunday that when he had approached an official \u2014 he did not name which one \u2014 to ask about an offensive pass-interference call against him in the first half, the official responded, \u201cGet out of my face.\u201d\n\nTerry McAulay was the referee Sunday and for the 2015 Giants-Panthers game. He was not the referee for the Giants-Redskins game in September, but six other officials from that day\u2019s crew did work in Sunday\u2019s game in Pittsburgh. A few of the officials have worked all three of the games mentioned by Beckham.\n\nSunday\u2019s officials, who under normal circumstances would speak only to a pool reporter after games, were not available by the time Beckham had made his comments, more than 30 minutes after the game had ended.\n\nBeckham said several times that he was not blaming the officials for Sunday\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s clearly not the reason we lost the game \u2014 just to make that clear,\u201d Beckham said calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. The Steelers are a very good team, and they beat us today.\u201d\n\nBut he returned to his account of his interaction with the official after the offensive-pass interference: \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what I did wrong so I don\u2019t do it again, and you\u2019re going to sit here and tell me, \u2018Get out of my face.\u2019\u201d\n", "science gender urry woman combat physics universe study peering holes megan spots continued bias black yale department specializes head inequities ground": "\nC. Megan Urry is a former president of the American Astronomical Society and the first woman to head the physics department at Yale University. Recently inducted to the National Academy of Sciences, she has published pioneering studies on the role of black holes in the formation of galaxies.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Dr. Urry helped organize 200 scientists who issued the Baltimore Charter for Women in Astronomy, which declared that \u201cwomen should not have to be clones of male astronomers in order to participate in mainstream astronomical research.\u201d\n\nMore recently, she announced that scientists with a record of sexual harassment would no longer be welcome at the astronomical society\u2019s meetings. We spoke at her New Haven, Conn., office. A condensed and edited version of the conversation follows.\n\nQ. Why was the meeting ban necessary?\n\nA. We had a situation where we had young female astronomers reporting conference experiences that were very different from those of their male counterparts. The men came and used the event to network. The women came and sometimes found themselves worried about people propositioning them.\n\nI wanted to make clear what our values are. I said straight out, \u201cLook, our meetings are not \u2018The Dating Game.\u2019 This is a professional environment. Act professionally.\u201d\n\nWas there much sexual harassment at astronomy conferences?\n\nProbably no more than at other corners of academe. It\u2019s a problem all over. I suspect we\u2019re hearing more about astronomy because our young people are complaining more.\n\nListen, two years ago, there was a survey published about scientific disciplines where people do field work. A high level of harassment was reported. For the men, the approaches came mainly from peers. The women reported being hit on by their superiors.\n\nThat\u2019s extremely troubling because in academia your career is in the hands of your adviser. If he\u2019s approaching you for sex, you\u2019re in trouble. There\u2019s generally no path forward in academe for the woman who has a powerful antagonist angry at her.\n\nWhat\u2019s your own story? Did you always want to be an astronomer?\n\nNo. In high school, I was the girl who was good at everything \u2014 English, history, math, science. For a while, I thought I might like to become the first woman president. A female chemistry teacher counseled me to think about a scientific career. She said I thought like a scientist because I was always comparing things to one another. I think it was my father, a science professor at Tufts, who suggested astrophysics.\n\nIn those days, the 1970s, I thought I\u2019d be able to do anything with my life. I chose physics because it was clean and elegant. I didn\u2019t go through that thing that often happens to teenage girls where they fall off of the cliff of self-confidence and get discouraged about science. The discouraging things happened later on.\n\nWhen? \n\nIn graduate school and later, when I was a postdoc at M.I.T. Before then, there was a lot of discrimination around me, but I had rationalizations. If I didn\u2019t see other females in advanced classes, I thought, \u201cMaybe no other woman wants to do this.\u201d I now think my attitude was laughable.\n\nWhen I got to M.I.T., in 1984, there were very few women full professors, maybe two. I was the only female postdoc at the Center for Space Research. It was there that I first started examining the environment I had chosen. I could see that there were plenty of young women starting out in STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] fields, though the higher one went, the fewer the women.\n\nWas the atmosphere at M.I.T. discouraging to your own ambitions? \n\nThe guy who hired me was wonderful, but there were very few women. I remember a male assistant professor once telling me I\u2019d have an easy time obtaining employment once I finished, because affirmative action \u201cgave women a big advantage over more qualified men.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, when I got my first faculty position, I saw more sexism. This was at the Space Telescope Science Institute, on the Johns Hopkins campus. At the time, around 15 percent of the Ph.D.s in astronomy went to women. Yet, there were only three other woman among 52 faculty members.\n\nWhen women applied for jobs, the guys would come hear their talks. Then, they\u2019d go, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know how much of that was hers.\u201d And then some guy gave a talk that was vague and undocumented, and they\u2019d go, \u201cLet\u2019s try to hire him.\u201d\n\nWhy remain at such a workplace? \n\nThe two-body problem. My husband worked near Baltimore, and I wanted to be where he was. And the work itself was exciting. We did the science for the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nI wasn\u2019t paid equally. How do I know? At a certain point, I received something called an \u201cequity raise,\u201d which signaled my pay was at the bottom of my cohort. Just about all the other women got similar equity raises. We were, as a group, at the bottom of the heap.\n\nI struggled between intellectual self-confidence and constant put-downs. Once, when I requested a raise because I\u2019d been offered tenure and a 30 percent increase at another institution, I was turned down with \u201cmaybe you\u2019re not as smart as you think you are.\u201d I cried for hours.\n\nAnother time, I applied for a job I was qualified for. A male administrator sneered, \u201cYou know what makes a leader? Someone others will follow \u2014 you\u2019re not that.\u201d\n\nI was so beaten down I didn\u2019t even argue.\n\nPeople say this is the best time in history to be doing astronomy. Is it?\n\nAbsolutely. The big news is in my own area \u2014 black holes, the center of galaxies. Last year, LIGO  [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory] detected gravitational waves from a pair of merging black holes in a galaxy probably a billion light-years away.\n\nThe waves were, of course, interesting by themselves. What fascinated me was that the merged black holes were roughly 30 times the mass of our sun. They were, at once, too small and too big for a black hole.\n\nIt\u2019s much smaller than the supermassive black holes we\u2019ve seen in the centers of galaxies, and much bigger than the black holes that come from exploding stars. It could be something entirely new.\n\nThanks to LIGO, we\u2019ve learned that the masses of the two black holes appear to have merged. The two are measured at about 30 solar masses, which is different, smaller, from what we usually see. There\u2019s some thought that they may be remnants from the first generation of stars.\n\nFor the past 15 years, I\u2019ve been discovering where and when black holes grew. My tools have been ground and space telescopes such as Keck and Hubble. We\u2019ve learned a lot from them. The LIGO discovery suggests a new way to study the universe.\n\n Will we not need those space-based satellites anymore? \n\nOn the contrary, the Chandra X-ray telescope and the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope have taught us the most about black holes. It appears that every black hole emits X-rays. The newest space telescopes spot them instantly.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope, which is slated to be launched in 2018, is utterly amazing. It\u2019s much bigger than Hubble, and it will enable us to see some of the first galaxies ever.\n\n \n", "east indianapolis contention separate wins nfl teams remain mondays afc jets sub500 matchup colts south buried": "\n8:30 p.m. Eastern, ESPN  Line: Colts by 1 \u00bd\n\nOnly two wins separate these sub-.500 teams, but what a difference division assignment makes.\n\nThe Colts have as good a chance as anyone to win the A.F.C.

In the best of circumstances, they believe that their donations will help a cause. Other times, they are just looking for an organization to take junk off their hands or validate their taste.\n\nThen there is the case of Jason Wolff. At the end of 2007, Mr. Wolff, who considers himself a value investor, bought 16 radio stations in the greater Los Angeles area. He did very well with them, and this year he got an offer to sell them. But after the transaction was completed, he still had one left.\n\n\u201cMy wife said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just give it to NPR?\u2019\u201d Mr. Wolff said. \u201cMy first response was, \u2018Because we can make a lot of money selling it.\u2019 But then I thought about it. Intellectually, this felt good. This felt like a value donation \u2014 if there is such a thing.\u201d\n\nSo he called the president of KCRW, the National Public Radio affiliate in Los Angeles, and asked if she wanted his radio station in San Luis Obispo, Calif.\n\n\u201cIt was so weird,\u201d said Jennifer Ferro, president of KCRW. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he meant.\u201d\n\nRadio stations are generally owned by conglomerates that are not in the business of giving them to public radio stations. But in this particular case, the offer seemed stranger still: Weeks before Mr. Wolff\u2019s offer, KCRW tried to buy a station in the same area but was outbid.\n\nMs. Ferro called her board and explained what was happening. \u201cThey said, \u2018Wait, you said we weren\u2019t going to be able to buy this station.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe time between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s Eve is the giving season, when Americans make the bulk of their charitable donations.\n\nMost of those gifts are checks written to favorite causes. But some come in the form of orphan radio stations, junked cars, unwanted boats or collections of baseball cards.\n\nAnd many charities are more than happy to accept gently used or even broken-down goods that can be sold, like old cars. The proceeds go toward their mission.\n\n\u201cWe bring in $500,000 a year from cars,\u201d Ms. Ferro said, adding that a station in San Diego gets more than $1 million from unwanted automobiles. \u201cNormally on a pledge drive, you\u2019d get $10 a month. But that same person would say, \u2018I have this car.\u2019 Someone may only give you $400 for that car, but that\u2019s $400 to KCRW.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent survey by U.S. Trust, a banking company that caters to the wealthy, only 10 percent of people make nonfinancial gifts \u2014 like works of art, land or collections of all sorts. More than 80 percent write checks, and half of those donations are made online.\n\nStill, more than twice as many people, the study found, give items rather than appreciated securities.\n\n\u201cI have a client who gave over a whole building, a rental apartment building, in the downturn,\u201d said Claire Costello, national practice executive for philanthropic solutions at U.S. Trust. \u201cThe charity ran the building and used the proceeds for its operations. It had nothing to do with social services.\u201d\n\nAs with any gift, advisers caution, people need to know what they want to accomplish with their donation before they make it, no matter what form it takes. And they need to understand the needs of the nonprofit.\n\n\u201cWe were involved once when someone wanted to donate a building to a small arts nonprofit,\u201d said Melissa Berman, president and chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. \u201cBut the building needed so much work that it wasn\u2019t clear they could remodel a building that had so much asbestos in it. In the end, it wasn\u2019t in the nonprofit\u2019s best interest to take the building without more support than was being offered.\u201d\n\nWhen the gifts and needs match, it works well. For potential heirs, it can also ease the worry about whether to keep something or sell it \u2014 and the speculation about what mom or dad would have done.\n\nMs. Costello thought of a client who had given a sizable collection of sports memorabilia to charity, a collection that probably cost the client more than it was worth. \u201cThe charity has zero investment in it, so what do they care what it\u2019s worth?\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking to recoup their investment, like the collector was. It\u2019s like the junk car. Who wants the junk car? But it\u2019s valuable.\u201d\n\nMany of these donations are one-offs. You have only one radio station or so many junked cars to give.\n\nBut there are other helpful ways to give away unwanted items. Ken Shubin Stein, a doctor turned investor, started Crutches 4 Kids with his sister and brother-in-law, both orthopedic surgeons. The premise is straightforward: collect no-longer-needed crutches and send them to the developing world, where lack of mobility is a public health problem for 50 million children.\n\nMr. Shubin Stein started the charity after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, when he saw a wave of children having legs amputated. Since then, the foundation has collected and distributed about 10,000 pairs of crutches.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about crutches is you can definitely solve the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re low-cost, lightweight, and there\u2019s no lucrative black market value, so they\u2019re not likely to be stolen.\u201d There are also schools and hospitals that serve as ready-made collection points for used crutches.\n\nMr. Shubin Stein said he and his family had been paying for the organization\u2019s annual budget, which is about $100,000. They have also relied on groups like Americares and MedShare International to transport the crutches that last mile.\n\n\u201cOur landed-and-delivered cost for children\u2019s crutches is about $10,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like the ultimate return on investment.\u201d\n\nWhat has limited this effort, he said, is the logistics of collecting the crutches more widely and then getting them to places in need.\n\nAnd this can be a challenge for anyone or any organization that wants to give or get: It\u2019s a lot harder to get things from one place to another than it is to use a credit card to make a financial donation. This is often true in the case of a natural disaster, when people send care packages.\n\n\u201cEven if these places need things like tents or canned goods, it may often be easier for the groups that can reach the afflicted to get local merchandise than deal with customs to get goods off the plane,\u201d Ms. Berman said. \u201cYou may be creating more of a headache than it\u2019s worth when you send the canned sweet potatoes.\u201d\n\nThat is not to say that small things aren\u2019t appreciated. Ms. Berman said donating toiletries to local homeless organizations can be helpful.\n\nJames Dondero, the founder of Highland Capital Management in Dallas, came up with a solution: When his company gets expensive bottles of wine or the use of an event space as thanks for its $3 million in annual giving, it gives them to another organization in need.\n\nThe wine, for example, goes to the American Heart Association\u2019s annual wine auction. The space, in places like the Dallas Zoo or the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, goes to smaller organizations that couldn\u2019t afford to rent such space themselves.\n\n\u201cWe make large gifts, so we have access to tables, admissions and golf tournaments,\u201d said Linda Owen, director of Highland\u2019s charitable giving program. \u201cWe\u2019ve calculated that there is value in this, and we thought, \u2018How can we give nonfinancial gifts to other organizations?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said the firm supported Education Is Freedom, which helps underserved children finish high school and get into college. It took the access it had to the Dallas Zoo and gave it to the group for its graduation ceremony, which the company also underwrote.\n\nThis matchmaking is not always easy. \u201cIt is labor-intensive,\u201d Ms. Owen said. \u201cOn one level, the easiest thing to do would be to decline these opportunities. But we try to be mindful and thoughtful about the access that we have.\u201d\n\nMr. Wolff said the radio station donation was surely bigger than any other gift he had made. He said he was still waiting for the appraiser to give him the final value, though he sold an inferior station in the same market for $600,000.\n\nAnd, like many people who get more involved in an organization, he said the gift felt different. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018The A-Team\u2019: \u2018I love it when a plan comes together.\u2019\u201d he said, quoting a line from the 1980s television show. \u201cThese guys are going to be able to fulfill their mission.\u201d\n", "move affordable law plans effective republicans delay health plan act date repeal gop congressional care": "\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans in Congress plan to move almost immediately next month to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as President-elect Donald J. Trump promised. But they also are likely to delay the effective date so that they have several years to phase out President Obama\u2019s signature achievement.\n\nThis emerging \u201crepeal and delay\u201d strategy, which Speaker Paul D. Ryan discussed this week with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, underscores a growing recognition that replacing the health care law will be technically complicated and could be politically explosive.\n\nSince the law was signed by Mr. Obama in March 2010, 20 million uninsured people have gained coverage, and the law has become deeply embedded in the nation\u2019s health care system, accepted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by consumers, doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and state and local governments.\n\nUnwinding it could be as difficult for Republicans as it was for Democrats to pass it in the first place and could lead Republicans into a dangerous cul-de-sac, where the existing law is in shambles but no replacement can pass the narrowly divided Senate. Democrats would face political pressure in that case as well.\n\nIt is not sheer coincidence that at least one idea envisions putting the effective date well beyond the midterm congressional elections in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to rip health care away from Americans,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which shares jurisdiction over health care. \u201cWe will have a transition period so Congress can develop the right policies and the American people can have time to look for better health care options.\u201d\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said: \u201cI imagine this will take several years to completely make that sort of transition \u2014 to make sure we do no harm, create a good health care system that everyone has access to, and that we repeal the parts of Obamacare that need to be repealed.\u201d\n\nBut health policy experts suggest \u201crepeal and delay\u201d would be extremely damaging to a health care system already on edge.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you can repeal the Affordable Care Act with a two- or three-year transition period and not create market chaos is a total fantasy,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University. \u201cInsurers need to know the rules of the road in order to develop plans and set premiums.\u201d\n\nDetails of the strategy are in flux, and there are disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. In the House, the emerging plan, tightly coordinated between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Pence, is meant to give Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters the repeal of the health law that he repeatedly promised at rallies. It would also give Republicans time to try to assure consumers and the health industry that they will not instantly upend the health insurance market, and to pressure some Democrats to support a Republican alternative.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you have to wait,\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, told reporters this week. \u201cI would move through and repeal and then go to work on replacing. I think once it\u2019s repealed, you will have hopefully fewer people playing politics, and everybody coming to the table to find the best policy.\u201d\n\nUnder the plan discussed this week, Republicans said, repeal will be on a fast track. They hope to move forward in January or February with a budget blueprint using so-called reconciliation instructions, which would allow parts of the health care law to be dismembered with a simple majority vote, denying Senate Democrats the chance to filibuster. They would follow up with legislation similar to a bill vetoed in January, which would have repealed the tax penalties for people who go without insurance and the penalties for larger employers who fail to offer coverage.\n\nThat bill would also have eliminated federal insurance subsidies, ended federal spending for the expansion of Medicaid, and barred federal payments to Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nBut in the Senate, Republicans would need support from some Democrats if they are to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe budget reconciliation rules that would allow Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act have strict limits. The rules are primarily intended to protect legislation that affects spending or revenues. The health law includes insurance market standards and other policies that do not directly affect the budget, and Senate Republicans would, in many cases, need 60 votes to change such provisions.\n\nRepealing the funding mechanisms but leaving in place the regulations risks a meltdown of the individual insurance market. Insurers could not deny coverage, but they would not get as many healthy new customers as they were expecting. Hospitals would again face many uninsured patients in their emergency rooms, without the extra Medicaid money they have been expecting.\n\nEven a delay of two to three years could be damaging. Health policy experts said the uncertainty could destabilize markets, unnerving insurers that have already lost hundreds of millions of dollars on policies sold in insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cInsurers would like clarity on the shape of the replacement plan to continue participating on exchanges if Obamacare is repealed,\u201d Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners who follows the insurance industry, said Friday.\n\nRepublicans are hoping that Mr. Trump will be able to use his bully pulpit to lean on vulnerable Democrats up for re-election in states Mr. Trump won, such as Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana.\n\n\u201cWhen that date came and you did nothing, if you want to play politics, I think the blame would go to people who didn\u2019t want to do anything,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nBut Democrats may not be so quick to break.\n\n\u201cIf they are looking at fixing what\u2019s there, I\u2019ve been wanting to work with Republicans for years now,\u201d said Mr. Tester, whose state cast just 36 percent of its vote for Hillary Clinton. \u201cBut if they are going to take away provisions like pre-existing conditions, lifetime caps, 26-year-olds, I think they are barking up the wrong tree.\u201d\n\nAnd some moderate Republicans see peril in repealing first and replacing later, favoring instead a simultaneous replacement to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n\u201cWe are firing live rounds this time,\u201d Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said. \u201cIf we repeal under reconciliation, we have to replace it under normal processes, and does anyone believe that the Senate Democrats, with their gentle tender mercies will help us?\u201d\n\nRepublicans said they would work with the Trump administration on replacement legislation that would draw on comprehensive plans drafted by Mr. Ryan and Representative Tom Price, the Georgia Republican picked by Mr. Trump to be his secretary of health and human services.\n\nAny legislation is likely to include elements on which Republicans generally agree: tax credits for health insurance; new incentives for health savings accounts; subsidies for state high-risk pools, to help people who could not otherwise obtain insurance; authority for sales of insurance across state lines; and some protection for people with pre-existing conditions who have maintained continuous coverage.\n\nRepublicans said they hoped that the certainty of repeal would increase pressure on Democrats to sign on to some of these ideas.\n\nDemocratic leaders, for now, feel no such pressure. Republicans \u201care going to have an awfully hard time\u201d if they try to repeal the health law without proposing a replacement, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next Democratic leader. \u201cThere would be consequences for so many millions of people.\u201d\n", "fashion takes crowd show paris runway turned french victorias secret spectacle": "\nPARIS \u2014 On Wednesday evening, Paris, the birthplace in 1889 of the modern bra (not to mention the home of many of the world\u2019s greatest fashion houses and runway shows), finally played host to the Fantasy Bra as the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show rolled out the pink carpet at the Grand Palais.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wanted to come here for many, many years,\u201d said Edward Razek, the executive producer of the show and the chief marketing officer of creative services at Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria\u2019s Secret. \u201cWithout Paris, I wonder whether Victoria\u2019s Secret could ever have existed. So when Les Wexner suggested coming, we set out to do our very best both as a guest in France, and as a host.\u201d Mr. Wexner is the chairman of Limited Brands.\n\nThe 45-minute runway show featured 51 models in 82 looks, with a roster that included Kendall Jenner, Adriana Lima, Irina Shayk, Joan Smalls, Alessandra Ambrosio and the sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid, as well as a number of fast-rising new faces, such as the Houston native Jourdana Phillips and the Iowan Alanna Arrington.\n\nAnd then the sweet, lacy nothings went into overdrive.

Live performances by Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars \u2014 grooving along in a fur coat and shades \u2014 and the Weeknd kept the energy running as the models shook their tail feathers, and 43 pairs of wings, for the cameras.\n\nJasmine Tookes wore the $3 million Bright Night bra set with 450 carats of diamonds and emeralds designed by Eddie Borgo. For the finale, Gaga got her own set of wings (on a white biker jacket), and the 12 angels fronted a final salute amid a shower of silver and gold confetti. The show got a seven-minute standing ovation.\n\nEighteen months in the making, the event took two weeks to set up and involved equipment transported in 45 trucks, armed soldiers, barricades, multiple checkpoints, photo IDs for all, bomb-sniffing dogs and a plainclothes detail. The usually frigid Grand Palais was heated. Mr. Razek said it was the most expensive fashion show ever, an investment in excess of $20 million.\n\nIt will also most likely smash records in viewership: Once the show is broadcast on Monday at 10 p.m. Eastern time on CBS, is posted on Victoria\u2019s Secret website the next day and enters worldwide distribution, its global audience is expected to hit 800 million viewers in more than 190 countries. That outstrips the Super Bowl many times over.\n\n\u201cPeople come with preconceived notions about what it is,\u201d Mr. Razek said of the show. \u201cBut the expectation is one thing. The reality is another. It\u2019s a really unique entertainment vehicle with a very broad appeal. Especially among women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of powerful women by powerful women who work very hard at what they do, live a healthy life and inspire legions of admirers. It speaks to diversity in a number of ways, as well as free-spiritedness. These girls are remarkable. Women recognize that and can relate to them in a way that no other fashion brand has.\u201d\n\nLingerie as a feminist issue? Maybe.\n\nThough equally interesting was that the French fashion crowd \u2014 including Azzedine Ala\u00efa; Carine Roitfeld; Riccardo Tisci and his muse L\u00e9a (who blew kisses to Ms. Smalls dressed as a black swan); Nina Ricci\u2019s artistic director, Guillaume Henry; and Balmain\u2019s designer, Olivier Rousteing \u2014 not only turned out for the event, but also had their own take on the matter.\n\nAccording to Clare Waight Keller, the creative director of Chlo\u00e9, \u201cWhenever a model does Victoria\u2019s Secret, her social media rankings go through the roof, and her rates follow accordingly.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Ms. Waight Keller had just wrapped shooting for Chlo\u00e9\u2019s fall campaign with one of the new Victoria\u2019s Secret faces (she wouldn\u2019t say whom). A preshow Instagram tally indicates that this year\u2019s crop of models has a combined reach of 164 million followers. Last year, after the London show, some models saw follower numbers leap by 250,000 overnight.\n\n\u201cIt was pure entertainment, which for the French is rather unusual,\u201d Mr. Henry said after the show.\n\nMr. Rousteing said: \u201cParis needs joy and happiness, and this was all about that in a wonderful mix of pop culture and fashion. Here you have the most beautiful women in the world daring to show how powerful, sexy and confident women can be, in all their diversity. It\u2019s everything I love.\u201d\n\nThen there was In\u00e8s de la Fressange, otherwise known for her associations with Chanel and Roger Vivier, who added: \u201cI think in France we sometimes lack a bit of lightness and gaiety in dressing. We have a huge culture of spectacle, but I think that sometimes we over-intellectualize dressing too much. I loved the lightness and fun, the youth. My daughters know everything about these models, so I\u2019m an old lady by comparison.\n\n\u201cBut when you look beyond the spectacle, there are pieces that you\u2019d wear everyday. It\u2019s a very smart move for the brand and a big gift for the rest of us.\u201d\n\nMs. Roitfeld declared Paris the perfect place for the show. \u201cIt was very joyful and American, but I also adore lingerie and know it well, so I know how hard it is to be sexy without being vulgar,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard thing to pull off. For me, that\u2019s the French touch, and they really pulled it off. Personally, my dream is to have the wings, but that would require lots of pushups and serious time at the gym.\u201d\n\nMaybe next year.\n", "entire eating users netflix mobile phones binge watch devices movies tablets plan offline data shows": "\nNetflix announced on Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when internet signals are spotty or unavailable.\n\nUsers boarding an airplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favorite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out.\n\nNetflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programs would become available for download later, saying only that there would be \u201cmore on the way.\u201d\n\nEven in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content offline would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously.\n\nCustomers who watch only a limited amount of video before incurring overage fees with their cellular carriers are more likely to stop watching videos \u2014 an unpalatable option for media companies like Netflix that want to keep eyes glued to their products.\n\nAT&T also appears to have come to a similar conclusion. In announcing DirecTV Now, a television service that can be streamed on mobile devices, the company said on Monday that its cellular customers would be able to watch shows without that usage counting toward their monthly data limits.\n\n\u201cThe last thing you want to do when you\u2019re binging or enjoying entertainment is trying to calculate how many gigs I\u2019m using or where I am in my data plan,\u201d Brad Bentley, AT&T\u2019s chief marketing officer, said on Monday, referring to gigabytes of data.\n\nNetflix is not the first video streaming company to introduce the offline option. Amazon Video, one of Netflix\u2019s biggest competitors, has made some videos available offline since September 2015.\n\nHulu does not offer offline viewing, but Ben Smith, Hulu\u2019s head of experience and a senior vice president, said on Tuesday that the company was working on it, according to CIO, an industry publication.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get there, for sure, in our industry,\u201d he said.\n", "selig playoffs success onfield apostle revenuesharing expanded find instituted reaches fame helped policies equity smallmarket teams hall bud": "\nBud Selig, the folksy former commissioner of Major League Baseball who presided over an unprecedented period of expansion, innovation and turmoil in the sport, was elected to the Hall of Fame on Sunday by the hall\u2019s restructured veterans committee along with John Schuerholz, the World Series-winning general manager with the Atlanta Braves and the Kansas City Royals.\n\n\u201cTo say this is a great day in my life would be an understatement,\u201d Selig said on a conference call Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve looked forward to this day for a long time and I\u2019m really honored to say the least.\u201d\n\nSelig was named on 15 ballots and Schuerholz on all 16 from a new version of the veterans\u2019 committee created to consider not only older players but also candidates who are not eligible for election through the traditional process, a vote by baseball writers. The group, the Today\u2019s Game Era Committee, is made up of eight Hall of Fame inductees, five M.L.B. executives and three writers and historians. Inductees needed a minimum of 12 votes at baseball\u2019s winter meetings outside of Washington.\n\nSelig and Schuerholz will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in July.\n\nGeorge Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees from 1973 until his death in 2010, was also on the ballot but received fewer than five votes, failing to be elected for the third time. Also on the ballot were the former players Mark McGwire, Albert Belle, Harold Baines, Orel Hershiser and Will Clark. Davey Johnson and Lou Piniella were also considered for their careers as managers.\n\nMcGwire, who hit 583 home runs but admitted to using steroids during his playing career, also received fewer than five votes.\n\nSelig, the original owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, led baseball from 1992 through 2014, one of the most dynamic and controversial periods in its history, in which the sport grew into a $10 billion-a-year industry. He governed, in part, through his ability to build consensus among the owners, perhaps his greatest skill.\n\n\u201cWe were a sport resistant to change,\u201d Selig said. \u201cI believe in those years that is the most change in baseball history.\u201d\n\nSelig, 82, was the acting commissioner during the worst strike in baseball history, a work stoppage that wiped out the 1994 World Series, and the so-called steroid era that so badly tarnished the image of the game. But baseball has now gone 22 years without a work stoppage, and, after great upheaval and acrimony, it has instituted a stringent drug policy.\n\n\u201cYes, it was terribly painful, broke my heart,\u201d he said of the 1994 strike. \u201cBut it served as a great lesson and we took it. The same thing with the steroid thing. Yes it was painful, yes it had its ups and downs. But we solved that problem. We now have the toughest testing program in American sports.\u201d\n\nSelig is credited with introducing popular innovations including the wild-card playoff system, realignment, interleague play and television replay of umpires\u2019 decisions, as well as with the creation of baseball\u2019s lucrative internet presence, M.L.B. Advanced Media.\n\nMore than anything, Selig was a tireless supporter of small-market and midmarket teams, pushing through revenue-sharing policies that redistributed millions of dollars from the larger market teams to the smaller ones. That, combined with the increased number of playoff spots, gave clubs from cities like Detroit, Houston, Kansas City and Tampa Bay entr\u00e9e into the World Series in recent years.\n\n\u201cWhat I inherited in \u201992 was a system that was archaic and hadn\u2019t been changed since what I call the Ebetts Field and Polo Grounds days,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proudest of that. It was painful and took a lot of time, but it saved a lot of small-market clubs who would tell you they wouldn\u2019t be in business.\u201d\n\nAnother of Selig\u2019s legacies \u2014 tethering the result of the All-Star Game to home-field advantage in the World Series \u2014 was rescinded in the latest version of baseball\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its players\u2019 union.\n\nSelig was also an advocate for recognizing baseball\u2019s role as a social institution. In 1997, he was instrumental in honoring Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball\u2019s color barrier in 1947, by having all teams retire Robinson\u2019s No. 42.\n\nOnce a minority owner of the Milwaukee Braves, Selig brought baseball back to Wisconsin in 1970 when he bought the Seattle Pilots, renamed them the Brewers and moved them into Milwaukee\u2019s County Stadium. He succeeded Fay Vincent, of whom he had been critical as an owner, as the acting commissioner of baseball in 1992, then assumed the role permanently in 1998.\n\nSchuerholz, 76, was the general manager of the Royals from 1981 until 1990 and presided over their 1985 World Series championship. He moved to Atlanta in 1990 to rebuild the last-place Braves, and within a year he had constructed a team that would go on to win 14 consecutive National League East titles (not including the strike year of 1994), five National League pennants and the 1995 World Series.\n\nResults of the regular annual election, the baseball writers\u2019 vote on recently retired candidates, will be announced on Jan. 18.\n", "undoing unusual studied psychologists bestselling project shaped lewis men michael ideas partnership chronicled author portrait moneyball work book": "\nMore than a decade ago, Michael Lewis was following a group of young baseball players through the minor leagues. He was working on a sequel to his 2003 best seller \u201cMoneyball,\u201d which chronicled how the Oakland A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane revolutionized the sport by using statistics to evaluate players.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to show where the revolution went,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Lewis tracked the players for two years, but the sequel never went anywhere. By then, \u201cMoneyball\u201d had become huge \u2014 it has now sold more than 1.7 million copies \u2014 and the subject felt overexposed.\n\nSo instead of tracking where the revolution went, Mr. Lewis decided to explore how it started.\n\nThe inquiry led him to the work of two Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, whose discoveries challenged long-held beliefs about human nature and the way the mind works.\n\nMr. Lewis chronicles their unusual partnership in his new book, \u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d a story about two unconventional thinkers who saw the world differently from everyone around them. Their peculiar area of research \u2014 how humans make decisions, often irrationally \u2014 has had profound implications for an array of fields, like professional sports, the military, medicine, politics, finance and public health.\n\nIt helped explain why a simple algorithm is often better than the most experienced doctors at diagnosing stomach cancer, why so many financial experts failed to foresee the implosion of the housing market, and why professional basketball teams make costly errors when picking players \u2014 in short, why people\u2019s instincts are often so wildly wrong.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. Kahneman won the Nobel in economic science, a field he had no formal training in, for demonstrating how people make decisions when faced with risks and uncertainty. (When asked if their work had any application to artificial intelligence, Mr. Tversky, who died in 1996, countered that they were more interested in exploring \u201cnatural stupidity.\u201d)\n\nWhen he began digging into their research, Mr. Lewis found an even more compelling story about a fertile intellectual partnership that ended too soon, when Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky had a falling-out over who was receiving more credit for their discoveries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a love story,\u201d Mr. Lewis said during an interview in Manhattan this fall. \u201cIt\u2019s this bromance of such great intensity, with such fertility, and the children are ideas, the children live on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d which will be released on Tuesday, seems like a departure for Mr. Lewis, whose best-known works have largely been character-driven narratives that reveal something unexpected about the way markets work. Often, they feature eccentrics and visionaries who see things that others are blind to \u2014 like Mr. Beane of the A\u2019s, or Michael Burry, the misanthropic hedge fund manager in \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d who made a fortune by betting against the housing market.\n\n\u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d centers on psychology, a field Mr. Lewis, a financial journalist who once worked as a Wall Street bond salesman, knew next to nothing about. \u201cI had cold feet about this, for very good reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nOn closer inspection, though, it becomes obvious that Mr. Kahneman\u2019s and Mr. Tversky\u2019s research shaped many of the subjects that Mr. Lewis has explored, to an almost unsettling degree.\n\n\u201cDanny and Amos\u2019s work has something to say about why baseball players get misvalued, or why people can\u2019t see the value of Michael Oher in \u2018The Blind Side,\u2019 or why people can\u2019t see what mortgage-backed securities really are,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a roundabout way, their work influenced Mr. Lewis\u2019s career. Their research demonstrating how people behave in fundamentally irrational ways when making decisions, relying on their gut rather than available data, gave rise to the field of behavioral economics. That discipline attracted Paul DePodesta, a Harvard student, who later went into sports management and helped upend professional baseball when he went to work for Mr. Beane.\n\n\u201cWithout their basic work, Michael Lewis doesn\u2019t get to write \u2018Moneyball,\u2019\u201d Starling Lawrence, Mr. Lewis\u2019s editor at W. W. Norton, said of Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Mr. Lewis read a 2003 review of \u201cMoneyball\u201d in The New Republic, which mentioned the connection between Mr. Kahneman\u2019s and Mr. Tversky\u2019s research and the data revolution in baseball, that he realized the extent to which their work had shaped the book. He became fascinated with their research and their unique partnership. Four years later, he finally worked up the nerve to call Mr. Kahneman and request a meeting.\n\nIt is hard to imagine Mr. Lewis, 56, feeling skittish around anyone. A New Orleans native, he comes across as someone who is at ease in any situation, whether he is shadowing professional athletes and coaches, foul-mouthed derivatives traders or bigwigs at the International Monetary Fund. After studying art history at Princeton and getting a master\u2019s degree from the London School of Economics, he worked at Salomon Brothers selling bonds. He left to write \u201cLiar\u2019s Poker,\u201d his 1989 memoir about his experience on Wall Street, which he sold to Mr. Lawrence at W. W. Norton. They have worked together ever since, on more than a dozen books.\n\nUnlike many nonfiction writers, Mr. Lewis declines to take advances, which he calls \u201ccorrupting,\u201d even though he could easily earn seven figures. Instead, he splits the profits from the books, as well as the advertising and production costs, with Norton. The setup spurs him to work harder and to make more money if the books are successful, he says.\n\n\u201cYou should have the risk and you should enjoy the reward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy for an author not to have the risk.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewis\u2019s books have sold more than nine million copies, and three have been adapted into successful feature films. Norton is printing nearly 500,000 hardcover copies of \u201cThe Undoing Project.\u201d\n\nOther authors speak about him with admiration bordering on reverence.\n\n\u201cHis willingness to jump in and take on these topics that are incredibly difficult to represent on the page has always left me awe-struck,\u201d the New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single book he\u2019s written that I thought I could have pulled off myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Undoing Project\u201d \u2014 which tackles abstract concepts like utility theory, prospect theory and heuristics \u2014 may be Mr. Lewis\u2019s most arcane and ambitious undertaking to date.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you write a book about a couple of psychologists,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. \u201cLet\u2019s just say, it\u2019s not promising in another writer\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Lewis first met Mr. Kahneman in 2007, over coffee at Mr. Kahneman\u2019s house in Berkeley, Calif., where Mr. Lewis also lives, he had no intention of writing a book about him. Instead, he found himself offering writing advice to Mr. Kahneman, who was struggling with his own book, which laid out his theories about human cognition and decision making.\n\n\u201cHe would say, \u2018It\u2019s going to ruin my reputation. I don\u2019t know why I agreed to do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cAt some point I said, \u2018If you\u2019re not going to do it, I\u2019m going to write something.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Kahneman\u2019s literary agent vetoed that idea. In 2011, Mr. Kahneman reluctantly published his book, \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow.\u201d It sold about 1.5 million copies.\n\nDespite the book\u2019s success, Mr. Lewis felt the story was incomplete. Mr. Kahneman had largely left out a huge piece of the narrative \u2014 his own biography and his complicated relationship with Mr. Tversky. Mr. Lewis continued to lobby Mr. Kahneman to let him write about their work.\n\nMr. Kahneman was ambivalent, arguing that the book would read like a textbook. \u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t understand what a good character you are, and the fact that you don\u2019t understand it is part of what makes you a good character,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lewis said.\n\nIt took a few years, but Mr. Kahneman finally acquiesced. \u201cHe\u2019s a pessimist, so he thought it would come out terribly,\u201d said Richard H. Thaler, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a longtime friend of both Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky. \u201cDanny needed to be convinced and charmed, and Michael was up to the task.\u201d\n\nOver the next eight years, as he completed other books, Mr. Lewis spent countless hours with Mr. Kahneman, hiking in the hills surrounding Berkeley, traveling to Israel with him twice, and meeting at his apartment in Manhattan. He also dug through Mr. Tversky\u2019s archives and correspondence, with the help of his widow, Barbara Tversky.\n\nPeople close to both men, including Mr. Thaler and Ms. Tversky, say Mr. Lewis captured the intensity of their relationship and their individual quirks. Colleagues described how the pair would finish each other\u2019s sentences and could often be heard cackling from behind an office door as they wrote dense academic papers. Mr. Tversky was the bold one who delighted in undermining well-established dogma within psychology. Mr. Kahneman was cautious, sensitive and deeply pessimistic.\n\nA few of the more colorful details in the book stray from reality, said Ms. Tversky, who praised Mr. Lewis for getting the \u201cbroad strokes right.\u201d For example, Ms. Tversky disputed a delightful anecdote about how her husband was so immune to social convention that he would strip down to his underwear and run outside when he felt like getting exercise. Actually, he would on occasion run on the treadmill in his underwear, but never outside, she said.\n\nMr. Kahneman, now 82, declined to be interviewed for this article, but offered a statement through his publisher.\n\n\u201cNaturally, there are points on which I would quibble, but this is Michael\u2019s book, not mine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome things in the book surprised me, some hurt, but I am glad it was written, and grateful to Michael for writing it. In the course of many conversations and countless email exchanges I came to understand the defining chapter of my life better than I had understood it before.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewis said he expected Mr. Kahneman to have a complex reaction to it.\n\n\u201cIt would be out of character for Danny just to like it, because he doesn\u2019t like much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would not be out of character for Danny to be kind and come to terms with it in a condescending way, like, that\u2019s the best he could do, and I admire him for trying as hard as he could.\u201d\n", "collecting brash transformer pennants league deserves unsavory spot american rejecting george steinbrenner cooperstown slights fame hall yankees": "\nOne of these days, the selectors ought to get real and vote George Steinbrenner into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nAt times he seemed like the worst person in the world \u2014 firing managers willy-nilly, ridiculing his own players, breaking the laws of the land as well as those of baseball. However, in that same epoch, the Yankees regained their ancient status, which is to say (with homage to George Orwell), spiked shoes on the neck of the American League.\n\nKnown as The Boss, Steinbrenner transformed the Yankees via a ton of television and turnstile money along with the new condition called free agency, plus his own brand of gall. Now his pungent blend of sour and sweet may be keeping him from the Hall, where character is said to be important.\n\nOn Sunday, the Hall announced that the former owner and commissioner Bud Selig had been selected by a special veterans committee, as had the longtime executive John Schuerholz, but not Steinbrenner, six years after his death at 80 and the third time he was on the ballot.\n\nFor that matter, Marvin Miller, the leader of the players\u2019 association who merely forced baseball into an era of unimagined star power and wealth via free agency, was not even under consideration after being rejected six times. The absence of Miller, who died at 95 in 2012, is one of the great scandals of the Hall.\n\nSo the classic insider made it, the classic outsider was shunned again, and The Boss remains in his personal limbo.\n\nSelig, retired and vibrant at 82, deserves the Hall, if only because he actually does know and love the game, and has from childhood, when his mother took him from Milwaukee to New York to watch Joe DiMaggio and Jackie Robinson. His Brewers won a pennant in 1982 and later he became commissioner, having one World Series canceled when he locked up with the obdurate Donald Fehr, Miller\u2019s successor at the players\u2019 association. Later Selig did a long, slow waltz with Fehr while a generation bulked up on performance-enhancing drugs. Nobody\u2019s perfect. Still, Selig deserves to be in the Hall for bringing labor peace and prosperity, as does Miller.\n\nFor his own reasons, so does Steinbrenner, who in this bombastic age is looking more layered and more cultured all the time. People recall how the tyrant wielded a verbal cat-o\u2019-nine-tails on his minions: One pitcher \u201cspit the bit\u201d in a crucial game; Dave Winfield, a future Hall of Famer, was \u201cMr. May\u201d because of his October struggles; the vulnerable Billy Martin was jerked around, as were more lovable managers; general managers \u2014 grown men \u2014 were sometimes forced to stay in their hotel rooms after a loss.\n\nThe Boss also bought a landmark franchise with dry rot and took advantage of free agency when Miller and Curt Flood forced the relaxing of baseball\u2019s reserve clause. Steinbrenner won four pennants from 1976 through 1981 and seven more from 1996 through 2009. Happy days were here again. Well, sometimes.\n\nIn November 1974, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended Steinbrenner for two years \u2014 later reduced to 15 months \u2014 after he pleaded guilty to conspiring to make illegal political contributions and also trying to force employees of his shipbuilding company to lie to a grand jury. Steinbrenner was fined $15,000 in the conspiracy case but given no jail time. (In 1989 the outgoing president, Ronald Reagan, pardoned him.)\n\nBy the 1980s, The Boss seemed to have lost his fastball and the Mets dominated the city. In 1986, I wrote a column suggesting he sell the Yankees to a brash New York builder with a penchant for slapping his name on all kinds of stuff. The Boss, however, was in it for the long haul. I\u2019ve often wondered what became of that real estate guy.\n\nIn July 1990, Commissioner Fay Vincent suspended Steinbrenner for making a $40,000 payment to a confessed gambler, Howard Spira, for damaging information about Winfield, the expensive star who had disappointed Steinbrenner.\n\nBut should these acts by Steinbrenner keep him from the Hall? The New York Times prohibits employees from voting for any honors, but my feeling is that Steinbrenner is a more important figure than many people in the Hall, including Tom Yawkey of the Boston Red Sox, a Southerner who shunned Robinson and all other black players until scandalously late; Charles Comiskey of the Chicago White Sox, who was so cheap that a nucleus of his team dumped the 1919 World Series; Connie Mack, a player-manager-owner of the old Philadelphia Athletics who sold his good players to richer teams; and Clark Griffith of the old Washington Senators, who underpaid players and did not mind finishing in the A.L.\u2019s lower depths.\n\nThe Boss was also lucky. During his second suspension, the general manager, Gene Michael, declined to sell off the best young players in the farm system, as Steinbrenner often did. When The Boss came back, he enjoyed a generation of Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada and, for a lot of years, Andy Pettitte.\n\nPeople remember other things about The Boss, like his tendency to talk about reading the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu. I remember him crying around reporters after the Yankees swept the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series and how, as an elder, I felt it was my duty to put an arm around him until the tears subsided.\n\nPeople still talk about his impulsive generosity: medical bills for people he hardly knew; befriending a street kid named Ray Negron, who has had an interesting life because of The Boss; putting Joe Pepitone on a retainer the moment Pepitone got out of Rikers Island from a short stay for possession of drugs; finding work for Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden \u2014 former Mets \u2014 after jail and chemical slippages. The Boss said he understood addiction and human frailty \u2014 and he backed it up with money and acts.\n\nThe Yankees have not reached the World Series since 2009, when the old baron was fading before our eyes. Under the stewardship of his two sons, the Yankees are just another rich, big-market organization that doesn\u2019t win. There was only one Boss, ever, and even with his complicated character, he belongs in the Hall.\n", "checkup monitored level simple pulse pressure part experts blood fitness check": "\nAerobic fitness should be considered a vital sign, just as body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and breathing rates are now, according to a new scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n\nThe statement points out that fitness can be a better indicator of someone\u2019s risk for heart disease and early death than such standard risk factors as smoking, obesity and high blood pressure. The authors recommend that each of us should have our aerobic fitness assessed as part of medical examinations and, if our fitness is on the low side, we should be advised and helped to start exercising.\n\nThe authors also suggest that if your physician does not begin to determine your aerobic fitness in the near future, you should do so yourself, using any of several scientifically validated online tools.\n\nAerobic, or cardiorespiratory, fitness is a measure of how well your body can deliver oxygen to tissues. Because that process is pervasive and essential within our bodies, it is also a \u201creflection of overall physiological health and function, especially of the cardiovascular system,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMany past studies have found that relatively low aerobic fitness is linked with a significantly increased risk for heart disease and premature death and that being out of shape may, in fact, represent a greater risk for developing heart disease than if you have a poor cholesterol profile, Type 2 diabetes, a history of smoking or a high body mass index.\n\nBut in 2013, when the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology released new guidelines for assessing someone\u2019s risk for heart disease, the criteria did not include aerobic fitness as a risk factor. The agencies were still uncertain about whether enough science existed to justify including fitness and also worried that the treadmill tests needed to measure aerobic fitness were complicated and costly.\n\nBut the research was compelling enough that the American Heart Association decided to convene an expert scientific advisory group that would gather and analyze all of the available studies about fitness, heart health and life spans, and also look into the question of whether fitness could be determined accurately and cheaply, without everyone needing to undergo a treadmill test.\n\nIn effect, the advisory board was asked to decide whether aerobic fitness should become a new vital sign.\n\nTheir answer, delivered in the new statement, which was published simultaneously in Circulation and Professional Heart Daily, a publication of the National Stroke Association, was a resounding yes.\n\nThe authors concluded that the available science overwhelmingly supported the use of aerobic fitness as a measure of general and heart health.\n\nAlmost as important from a practical standpoint, the authors also determined that newly developed equations and simple calculators could provide reliable, valid estimates of fitness. Doctors could use a few keystrokes to estimate someone\u2019s fitness, instead of ordering a treadmill test (although some people, especially those at high risk for heart disease based on other factors, should still undergo treadmill testing, the authors write).\n\nThe resulting scientific statement \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the use of cardiorespiratory fitness as a vital sign and \u201can important measure and predictor of health,\u201d says Steven Blair, a professor of exercise science and epidemiology at the University of South Carolina and co-chairman of the scientific committee.\n\nThe statement, which went through peer review, as well as a separate review and endorsement by the standing scientific advisory board for the American Heart Association, is, however, only a recommendation and does not change the current formal heart disease risk calculations.\n\nBut the statement\u2019s authors are hopeful that it will have an immediate and lingering impact.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think that doctors understand that cardiorespiratory fitness is important,\u201d says Leonard Kaminsky, the director of the Fisher Institute of Health and Well-Being at Ball State University in Indiana and co-author of the statement.\n\nBut many physicians \u201cconsider it to be relatively less important than other risk factors,\u201d he continues. \u201cHopefully this scientific statement will be a resource and give them confidence in the solid evidence base for cardiorespiratory fitness as a vital health measure.\u201d\n\nThe statement also should be of interest to and practical use by those of us who do not hold medical degrees but do own hearts and lungs, the authors say.\n\n\u201cIt would be an excellent idea\u201d for everyone to learn his or her current, estimated aerobic fitness level and how it compares to age-matched averages, says Dr. Chip Lavie, a cardiologist and exercise scientist at the Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in Louisiana and statement co-author.\n\nHe suggests using an online fitness calculator developed by Dr. Kaminsky and others, based on data from millions of users, at www.worldfitnesslevel.org.\n\nTake the resulting estimate of your fitness age to your next medical appointment and discuss it with your physician, Dr. Lavie says.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are concerned about your current fitness, get up and move. Fitness is quite malleable, the statement co-authors point out.
