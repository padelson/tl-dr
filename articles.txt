{"Hands on with Apple's iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Apple TV": "Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen \u2014 much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.\n\nAt the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone\n\nThe 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.\n\nA light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions \u2014 for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.\n\nI found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.\n\nThe new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad\n\nThe iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.\n\nThe iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.\n\nThe large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV\n\nThe Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.\n\nI decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.\n\nI also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said \"comedy,\" thinking I had said \"comity.\" But it did a better job with action movies \u2014 when I said \"show me action movies,\" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.\n\nThe new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nFollow Digital Life on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.", "Euro up; USD, Pound and Yen down": "Mumbai, Sep 11 : Following were the indicative currency notes\u00a0 and travellers\u2019 cheques buying and selling rates per unit\u00a0 today.\u00a0 CURRENCY NAME BUY SALE UAE DIRHAM 16.7276 19.1652 AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR 43.7311 49.3792\u00a0 BANGLADESH TAKA 0.782276 0.921413\u00a0 BAHRAIN DINAR 163.3139 186.6076 CANADIAN DOLLAR 46.2854 53.1733\u00a0 SWISS FRANC 63.3832 72.8305 CHINESE YUAN 7.36 11.96 DANISH KRONE 9.1253 10.6636     EURO 69.8139 79.004\u00a0 STERLING POUND 95.581 108.1744 HONG KONG DOLLAR 7.7277 9.2278\u00a0 JAPANESE YEN 0.5098 0.5795 KUWAITI DINAR 181.7544 225.9568\u00a0\u00a0 SRI LANKA RUPEE 0.4387 0.5162 MALAYSIAN RINGITT 13.6713 16.8179 NORWEGIAN KRONE 7.3399 8.6565 NEPALESE RUPEE 0.5749 0.6251 NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR 38.0173 44.6709 OMANI RIAL 160.016414 182.547573 PAKISTAN RUPEE 0.5835 0.6864 QATARI RIAL 16.8627 19.3201 SAUDI RIAL 16.3564 18.9515 SWEDISH KRONA 7.1261 8.4018 SINGAPORE DOLLAR 42.9001 50.6758 THAI BAHT 1.6894 2.0027 US DOLLAR 61.8807 70.0204 SOUTH AFRICAN RAND 4.2193 5.1954", "Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders": "VETERANS saluted Worcester's first ever breakfast club for ex-soldiers which won over hearts, minds and bellies. \n \nThe Worcester Breakfast Club for HM Forces Veterans met at the Postal Order in Foregate Street at 10am on Saturday. \n \nThe club is designed to allow veterans a place to meet, socialise, eat and drink, giving hunger and loneliness their marching orders. \n \nFather-of-two Dave Carney, aged 43, of Merrimans Hill, Worcester, set up the club after being inspired by other similar clubs across the country. \n \nHe said: \"As you can see from the picture, we had a good response. Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \n \n\"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \n \n\"It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" \n \nHe said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. \n \nMr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. \n \nHe was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. \n \nMr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. \n \nThe Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. \n \nThe management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. \n \nThe breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.", "This New Dating App Will Ruin Your Internet Game": "NYMag.com Daily Intelligencer Vulture The Cut Science of Us Grub Street Bedford & Bowery FOLLOW: Facebook Twitter UserName LOG IN REGISTER Fashions Runway Street Style Designers Fame Beauty Goods Love & War search Sections Fashions Fame Beauty Goods Love & War Plus Runway Street Style Designers Sites NYMag.com Daily Intelligencer Vulture Science of Us Grub Street Bedford & Bowery Like UsFollow Us Popular on The Cut Ask Polly: Should I Just Give Up on My Writing? \u00bb Top Shows Oscar de la Renta See it \u00bb Michael Kors See it \u00bb Suno See it \u00bb Coach See it \u00bb Narciso Rodriguez See it \u00bb Tory Burch See it \u00bb Carolina Herrera See it \u00bb Rodarte See it \u00bb Diesel Black Gold See it \u00bb Jeremy Scott See it \u00bb Thom Browne See it \u00bb rag & bone See it \u00bb Tommy Hilfiger See it \u00bb Prabal Gurung See it \u00bb Diane Von Furstenberg See it \u00bb keeping us honest September 16, 2015 7:12 p.m. This New Dating App Will Ruin Your Internet Game By Allison P.

You bet I do.\u00a0 Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us. \u00a0 Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are now \u2014 bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo \u2014 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?\nAt first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering.

The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.  \n \nThey contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, \u201cScientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.\u201d We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; \u201cwhat is my objective in saying this.\u201d \u201cAre these words going to produce life or death.\u201d Proverbs 18:21 declares, \u201cDeath and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.\u201d \n \n\nAs a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else\u2019s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. \n \nAs responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people\u2019s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person\u2019s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. \n \n\nProverbs 19:1 says, \u201cBetter is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.\u201d We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. \n \nWe are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. \n \n\nWe should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. \n \nIf we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, \u201cWhen a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil\u201d (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. \n \n\nDue to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. \n \nThe question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl\u2019s life, Flo-Jo. \n \nWhen narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, \u201cSugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.\u201d She continued and said, \u201cRight then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.\u201d \n \n\nWith words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls\u2019 life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. \n \nPaul\u2019s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, \u201cLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.\u201d (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation.", "Jumpshot Gives Marketers Renewed Visibility Into Paid and Organic Keywords With Launch of Jumpshot Elite": "New Product Gives Marketers Access to Real Keywords, Conversions and Results Along With 13 Months of Historical Data \n\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/17/15 -- Jumpshot, a marketing analytics company that uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online customer journey, today announced the launch of Jumpshot Elite, giving marketers insight into what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on your site. For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. \n\n\"Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,\" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. \"Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred.\" \n\nUnlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. \n\nAvailable today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: \n\nAccess to real queries used by searchers \n\nPaid and organic results for any website \n\nVisibility into organic keywords, eliminating the \"not provided\" outcome in web analytics \n\nReal user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results \n\nAbility to tie keywords to real transactions on any website \n\nVariable attribution models and lookback windows \n\nLaunched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. \n\nThe company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. \n\nAbout Jumpshot \n\nJumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable. Jumpshot was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco. \n\nFor more information, please visit www.jumpshot.com. \n\nImage Available: http://www2.marketwire.com/mw/frame_mw?attachid=2889222 \n\nKelly Mayes \n\nThe Bulleit Group \n\n615-200-8845 \n\nPublished Sep. 17, 2015 \n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 SYS-CON Media, Inc. \u2014 All Rights Reserved. \n\nSyndicated stories and blog feeds, all rights reserved by the author.", "What will happen to Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane, Liberal power couple?": "Tony Abbott's last word  \nWatch the last press conference of outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott in full. \n PT6M11S   620  349    \n\nThey're the power couple who have run the Liberal Party back-room operation\u00a0since December\u00a02009. \n\nBut Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister will\u00a0inevitably\u00a0lead to his high-profile chief of staff, Peta Credlin, quitting the blue carpet\u00a0in Parliament House's ministerial wing. \n \nPeta Credlin and Brian Loughnane arrive for the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in June. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nWhat will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. \n \nMs Credlin\u00a0worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as\u00a0opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not\u00a0be\u00a0working for the incoming leader. \n\nAfter her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the\u00a0dominant figure in the Abbott government,\u00a0described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies \u2014\u00a0not least Mr Abbott, who called her the \"fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with\". \u00a0As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile\u00a0staffers in recent political\u00a0history. \n \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst\u00a0and\u00a0Claire Kimball, honing and refining\u00a0Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. \n\nAfter just less than\u00a0four years in opposition,\u00a0 in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government,\u00a0made the transition as chief of staff into government. \n\nBut the tightly controlled approach adopted in\u00a0opposition\u00a0did not work\u00a0as smoothly in government. \n \nMr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013.

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nBut Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he\u00a0singled out his chief of staff \u00a0\"who has been unfairly maligned by people who\u00a0should've\u00a0known better\". \n\nAnd now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. \n\nMr\u00a0Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. \n\nOne veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader,\u00a0and that a change in director was not \"necessary or inevitable\". \n\nThat veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of \"competitive tension\" between it and Liberal Party HQ. \n\n\"It depends on the relationship between the two of them;\u00a0[Mr Loughnane] has served every\u00a0leader\u00a0since Howard.     \u00a0But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director \u2013 you can't have a situation like [former prime minister]\u00a0Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996].\" \n\nA second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was \"very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on.\u00a0The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience.\" \n\nFairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. \n\nThe former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department,\u00a0Drew Clarke, will serve as his\u00a0acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt,\u00a0who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos\u00a0in the office of John Howard,\u00a0will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. \n\nSenator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude\u00a0of Mr\u00a0Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach,\u00a0\"and\u00a0have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,\" he told Sky News. \n\n\"The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off;\u00a0the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. \n\n\"You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.\" \n\nFollow James Massola on Facebook . \n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Pay up or face legal action: DBKL": "KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 15 (MySinchew) -- The Kuala Lumpur City Hall today issued an ultimatum to Bersih 2.0 to pay the clean-up bill by this month or face legal action.\n\nDeputy federal territories minister Datuk Loga Bala Mohan Jaganathan said the bill amounting to RM61,840 includes the monitoring cost and cleaning of banners and graffiti as well as repair of damaged infrastructure.\n\nHe said DBKL would bring this matter to the court if Bersih 2.0 failed to pay up.", "Harwood Feffer LLP Announces Investigation of VASCO Data Security International, Inc.": "SOURCE Harwood Feffer LLP\n\nNEW YORK \n\nOn July 21, 2015 \n\nOn this news, VASCO stock nearly 33% and has not recovered. \n\nOur investigation concerns whether the Company board of directors has breached its fiduciary duties to shareholders, grossly mismanaged the Company, and/or committed abuses of control in connection with the foregoing. \n\nIf you own VASCO shares and wish to discuss this matter with us, or have any questions concerning your rights and interests with regard to this matter, please contact:\n\nRobert I.
